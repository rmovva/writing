If it was a question of an Imperium, he\nsaid to himself, and if one wished, as a Roman, to recover a little the\nsense of that, the place to do so was on London Bridge, or even, on a\nfine afternoon in May, at Hyde Park Corner. It was not indeed to either\nof those places that these grounds of his predilection, after all\nsufficiently vague, had, at the moment we are concerned with him, guided\nhis steps; he had strayed, simply enough, into Bond Street, where his\nimagination, working at comparatively short range, caused him now and\nthen to stop before a window in which objects massive and lumpish, in\nsilver and gold, in the forms to which precious stones contribute, or\nin leather, steel, brass, applied to a hundred uses and abuses, were as\ntumbled together as if, in the insolence of the Empire, they had been\nthe loot of far-off victories. The young man\u2019s movements, however,\nbetrayed no consistency of attention\u2014not even, for that matter, when\none of his arrests had proceeded from possibilities in faces shaded,\nas they passed him on the pavement, by huge beribboned hats, or more\ndelicately tinted still under the tense silk of parasols held at\nperverse angles in waiting victorias. And the Prince\u2019s undirected\nthought was not a little symptomatic, since, though the turn of\nthe season had come and the flush of the streets begun to fade, the\npossibilities of faces, on the August afternoon, were still one of the\nnotes of the scene. He was too restless\u2014that was the fact\u2014for any\nconcentration, and the last idea that would just now have occurred to\nhim in any connection was the idea of pursuit.\n\nHe had been pursuing for six months as never in his life before, and\nwhat had actually unsteadied him, as we join him, was the sense of how\nhe had been justified. Capture had crowned the pursuit\u2014or success,\nas he would otherwise have put it, had rewarded virtue; whereby the\nconsciousness of these things made him, for the hour, rather serious\nthan gay. A sobriety that might have consorted with failure sat in his\nhandsome face, constructively regular and grave, yet at the same time\noddly and, as might be, functionally almost radiant, with its dark\nblue eyes, its dark brown moustache and its expression no more sharply\n\u201cforeign\u201d to an English view than to have caused it sometimes to be\nobserved of him with a shallow felicity that he looked like a \u201crefined\u201d\n Irishman. What had happened was that shortly before, at three o\u2019clock,\nhis fate had practically been sealed, and that even when one pretended\nto no quarrel with it the moment had something of the grimness of a\ncrunched key in the strongest lock that could be made. There was nothing\nto do as yet, further, but feel what one had done, and our personage\nfelt it while he aimlessly wandered. It was already as if he were\nmarried, so definitely had the solicitors, at three o\u2019clock, enabled the\ndate to be fixed, and by so few days was that date now distant. He was\nto dine at half-past eight o\u2019clock with the young lady on whose behalf,\nand on whose father\u2019s, the London lawyers had reached an inspired\nharmony with his own man of business, poor Calderoni, fresh from Rome\nand now apparently in the wondrous situation of being \u201cshown London,\u201d\n before promptly leaving it again, by Mr. Verver himself, Mr. Verver\nwhose easy way with his millions had taxed to such small purpose, in the\narrangements, the principle of reciprocity. The reciprocity with which\nthe Prince was during these minutes most struck was that of Calderoni\u2019s\nbestowal of his company for a view of the lions. If there was one thing\nin the world the young man, at this juncture, clearly intended, it was\nto be much more decent as a son-in-law than lots of fellows he could\nthink of had shown themselves in that character. He thought of these\nfellows, from whom he was so to differ, in English; he used, mentally,\nthe English term to describe his difference, for, familiar with the\ntongue from his earliest years, so that no note of strangeness remained\nwith him either for lip or for ear, he found it convenient, in life, for\nthe greatest number of relations. He found it convenient, oddly, even\nfor his relation with himself\u2014though not unmindful that there might\nstill, as time went on, be others, including a more intimate degree of\nthat one, that would seek, possibly with violence, the larger or the\nfiner issue\u2014which was it?\u2014of the vernacular. Miss Verver had told him\nhe spoke English too well\u2014it was his only fault, and he had not been\nable to speak worse even to oblige her. \u201cWhen I speak worse, you see,\nI speak French,\u201d he had said; intimating thus that there were\ndiscriminations, doubtless of the invidious kind, for which that\nlanguage was the most apt. The girl had taken this, she let him know,\nas a reflection on her own French, which she had always so dreamed of\nmaking good, of making better; to say nothing of his evident feeling\nthat the idiom supposed a cleverness she was not a person to rise to.\nThe Prince\u2019s answer to such remarks\u2014genial, charming, like every answer\nthe parties to his new arrangement had yet had from him\u2014was that he was\npractising his American in order to converse properly, on equal terms as\nit were, with Mr. Verver. His prospective father-in-law had a command of\nit, he said, that put him at a disadvantage in any discussion; besides\nwhich\u2014well, besides which he had made to the girl the observation that\npositively, of all his observations yet, had most finely touched her."}

It was a comfort to reflect that Ascham was so punctual--the\nsuspense was beginning to make his host nervous. And the sound of the\ndoor-bell would be the beginning of the end--after that there\u2019d be no\ngoing back, by God--no going back!\n\nGranice resumed his pacing. Each time he reached the end of the room\nopposite the door he caught his reflection in the Florentine mirror\nabove the fine old walnut _credence_ he had picked up at Dijon--saw\nhimself spare, quick-moving, carefully brushed and dressed, but\nfurrowed, gray about the temples, with a stoop which he corrected by\na spasmodic straightening of the shoulders whenever a glass confronted\nhim: a tired middle-aged man, baffled, beaten, worn out.\n\nAs he summed himself up thus for the third or fourth time the door\nopened and he turned with a thrill of relief to greet his guest. But it\nwas only the man-servant who entered, advancing silently over the mossy\nsurface of the old Turkey rug.\n\n\u201cMr. Ascham telephones, sir, to say he\u2019s unexpectedly detained and can\u2019t\nbe here till eight-thirty.\u201d\n\nGranice made a curt gesture of annoyance. It was becoming harder and\nharder for him to control these reflexes. He turned on his heel, tossing\nto the servant over his shoulder: \u201cVery good. Put off dinner.\u201d\n\nDown his spine he felt the man\u2019s injured stare. Mr. Granice had always\nbeen so mild-spoken to his people--no doubt the odd change in his manner\nhad already been noticed and discussed below stairs. And very likely\nthey suspected the cause. He stood drumming on the writing-table till he\nheard the servant go out; then he threw himself into a chair, propping\nhis elbows on the table and resting his chin on his locked hands.\n\nAnother half hour alone with it!\n\nHe wondered irritably what could have detained his guest. Some\nprofessional matter, no doubt--the punctilious lawyer would have allowed\nnothing less to interfere with a dinner engagement, more especially\nsince Granice, in his note, had said: \u201cI shall want a little business\nchat afterward.\u201d\n\nBut what professional matter could have come up at that unprofessional\nhour? Perhaps some other soul in misery had called on the lawyer; and,\nafter all, Granice\u2019s note had given no hint of his own need! No doubt\nAscham thought he merely wanted to make another change in his will.\nSince he had come into his little property, ten years earlier, Granice\nhad been perpetually tinkering with his will."}

The hooded Death has missed!\n             (_Woe betide thee, Nag!_)\n\nThis is the story of the great war that Rikki-tikki-tavi fought\nsingle-handed, through the bath-rooms of the big bungalow in Segowlee\ncantonment. Darzee, the tailor-bird, helped him, and Chuchundra, the\nmusk-rat, who never comes out into the middle of the floor, but\nalways creeps round by the wall, gave him advice; but Rikki-tikki did\nthe real fighting.\n\nHe was a mongoose, rather like a little cat in his fur and his tail,\nbut quite like a weasel in his head and habits. His eyes and the end\nof his restless nose were pink; he could scratch himself anywhere he\npleased, with any leg, front or back, that he chose to use; he could\nfluff up his tail till it looked like a bottle-brush, and his\nwar-cry, as he scuttled through the long grass, was:\n'_Rikk-tikk-tikki-tikki-tchk!_'\n\nOne day, a high summer flood washed him out of the burrow where he\nlived with his father and mother, and carried him, kicking and\nclucking, down a roadside ditch. He found a little wisp of grass\nfloating there, and clung to it till he lost his senses. When he\nrevived, he was lying in the hot sun on the middle of a garden path,\nvery draggled indeed, and a small boy was saying: 'Here's a dead\nmongoose. Let's have a funeral.'\n\n'No,' said his mother; 'let's take him in and dry him. Perhaps he\nisn't really dead.'\n\nThey took him into the house, and a big man picked him up between his\nfinger and thumb, and said he was not dead but half choked; so they\nwrapped him in cotton-wool, and warmed him and he opened his eyes and\nsneezed.\n\n'Now,' said the big man (he was an Englishman who had just moved into\nthe bungalow); 'don't frighten him and we'll see what he'll do.'\n\nIt is the hardest thing in the world to frighten a mongoose, because\nhe is eaten up from nose to tail with curiosity. The motto of all the\nmongoose family is 'Run and find out'; and Rikki-tikki was a true\nmongoose. He looked at the cotton-wool, decided that it was not good\nto eat, ran all round the table, sat up and put his fur in order,\nscratched himself, and jumped on the small boy's shoulder."}

After five years\u2019 service a man is directly or indirectly\nacquainted with the two or three hundred Civilians in his Province, all\nthe Messes of ten or twelve Regiments and Batteries, and some fifteen\nhundred other people of the non-official caste. In ten years his\nknowledge should be doubled, and at the end of twenty he knows, or knows\nsomething about, every Englishman in the Empire, and may travel anywhere\nand everywhere without paying hotel-bills.\n\nGlobe-trotters who expect entertainment as a right, have, even within my\nmemory, blunted this open-heartedness, but none the less to-day, if you\nbelong to the Inner Circle and are neither a Bear nor a Black Sheep,\nall houses are open to you, and our small world is very, very kind and\nhelpful.\n\nRickett of Kamartha stayed with Polder of Kumaon some fifteen years ago.\nHe meant to stay two nights, but was knocked down by rheumatic fever,\nand for six weeks disorganized Polder\u2019s establishment, stopped Polder\u2019s\nwork, and nearly died in Polder\u2019s bedroom. Polder behaves as though he\nhad been placed under eternal obligation by Rickett, and yearly\nsends the little Ricketts a box of presents and toys. It is the same\neverywhere. The men who do not take the trouble to conceal from you\ntheir opinion that you are an incompetent ass, and the women who blacken\nyour character and misunderstand your wife\u2019s amusements, will work\nthemselves to the bone in your behalf if you fall sick or into serious\ntrouble.\n\nHeatherlegh, the Doctor, kept, in addition to his regular practice,\na hospital on his private account--an arrangement of loose boxes for\nIncurables, his friend called it--but it was really a sort of fitting-up\nshed for craft that had been damaged by stress of weather. The weather\nin India is often sultry, and since the tale of bricks is always a fixed\nquantity, and the only liberty allowed is permission to work overtime\nand get no thanks, men occasionally break down and become as mixed as\nthe metaphors in this sentence.\n\nHeatherlegh is the dearest doctor that ever was, and his invariable\nprescription to all his patients is, \u201clie low, go slow, and keep cool.\u201d\n He says that more men are killed by overwork than the importance of this\nworld justifies. He maintains that overwork slew Pansay, who died under\nhis hands about three years ago. He has, of course, the right to speak\nauthoritatively, and he laughs at my theory that there was a crack\nin Pansay\u2019s head and a little bit of the Dark World came through and\npressed him to death. \u201cPansay went off the handle,\u201d says Heatherlegh,\n\u201cafter the stimulus of long leave at Home. He may or he may not have\nbehaved like a blackguard to Mrs. Keith-Wessington. My notion is that\nthe work of the Katabundi Settlement ran him off his legs, and that he\ntook to brooding and making much of an ordinary P. & O. flirtation. He\ncertainly was engaged to Miss Mannering, and she certainly broke off the\nengagement. Then he took a feverish chill and all that nonsense about\nghosts developed.

His home\nwithout one was like an empty temple in which there is no altar, no\noffering. So keenly did he realize the necessity that a dozen times at\nleast during the past year he had been on the point of proposing\nmarriage to almost as many different young women of the neighborhood.\nTherein lay the difficulty, the trouble which Tel\u00e8sphore experienced in\nmaking up his mind. Elvina\u2019s eyes were beautiful and had often tempted\nhim to the verge of a declaration. But her skin was over swarthy for a\nwife; and her movements were slow and heavy; he doubted she had Indian\nblood, and we all know what Indian blood is for treachery. Amaranthe\npresented in her person none of these obstacles to matrimony. If her\neyes were not so handsome as Elvina\u2019s, her skin was fine, and being\nslender to a fault, she moved swiftly about her household affairs, or\nwhen she walked the country lanes in going to church or to the store.\nTel\u00e8sphore had once reached the point of believing that Amaranthe would\nmake him an excellent wife. He had even started out one day with the\nintention of declaring himself, when, as the god of chance would have\nit, Ma\u2019me Valtour espied him passing in the road and enticed him to\nenter and partake of coffee and \u201cbaign\u00e9s.\u201d He would have been a man of\nstone to have resisted, or to have remained insensible to the charms and\naccomplishments of the Valtour girls. Finally there was Ganache\u2019s widow,\nseductive rather than handsome, with a good bit of property in her own\nright. While Tel\u00e8sphore was considering his chances of happiness or even\nsuccess with Ganache\u2019s widow, she married a younger man."}

It chanced that the writer was familiar with a part of\nEngland that lay within hail of the watering-place in which King\nGeorge the Third had his favourite summer residence during the war\nwith the first Napoleon, and where he was visited by ministers and\nothers who bore the weight of English affairs on their more or less\ncompetent shoulders at that stressful time.  Secondly, this district,\nbeing also near the coast which had echoed with rumours of invasion\nin their intensest form while the descent threatened, was formerly\nanimated by memories and traditions of the desperate military\npreparations for that contingency.  Thirdly, the same countryside\nhappened to include the village which was the birthplace of Nelson's\nflag-captain at Trafalgar.\n\nWhen, as the first published result of these accidents, _The Trumpet\nMajor_ was printed, more than twenty years ago, I found myself in\nthe tantalizing position of having touched the fringe of a vast\ninternational tragedy without being able, through limits of plan,\nknowledge, and opportunity, to enter further into its events; a\nrestriction that prevailed for many years.  But the slight regard\npaid to English influence and action throughout the struggle by\nthose Continental writers who had dealt imaginatively with Napoleon's\ncareer, seemed always to leave room for a new handling of the theme\nwhich should re-embody the features of this influence in their true\nproportion; and accordingly, on a belated day about six years back,\nthe following drama was outlined, to be taken up now and then at wide\nintervals ever since.\n\nIt may, I think, claim at least a tolerable fidelity to the facts of\nits date as they are give in ordinary records.  Whenever any evidence\nof the words really spoken or written by the characters in their\nvarious situations was attainable, as close a paraphrase has been\naimed at as was compatible with the form chosen.  And in all cases\noutside the oral tradition, accessible scenery, and existing relics,\nmy indebtedness for detail to the abundant pages of the historian,\nthe biographer, and the journalist, English and Foreign, has been,\nof course, continuous.\n\nIt was thought proper to introduce, as supernatural spectators\nof the terrestrial action, certain impersonated abstractions, or\nIntelligences, called Spirits.  They are intended to be taken by the\nreader for what they may be worth as contrivances of the fancy merely.\nTheir doctrines are but tentative, and are advanced with little eye\nto a systematized philosophy warranted to lift \u201cthe burthen of the\nmystery\u201d of this unintelligible world.  The chief thing hoped for\nthem is that they and their utterances may have dramatic plausibility\nenough to procure for them, in the words of Coleridge, \u201cthat willing\nsuspension of disbelief for the moment which constitutes poetic\nfaith.\u201d  The wide prevalence of the Monistic theory of the Universe\nforbade, in this twentieth century, the importation of Divine\npersonages from any antique Mythology as ready-made sources or\nchannels of Causation, even in verse, and excluded the celestial\nmachinery of, say, _Paradise Lost_, as peremptorily as that of the\n_Iliad_ or the _Eddas_.  And the abandonment of the masculine pronoun\nin allusions to the First or Fundamental Energy seemed a necessary\nand logical consequence of the long abandonment by thinkers of the\nanthropomorphic conception of the same."}

He had lived his\nlife, made a little money and spent it all, as every good Hindu should\ndo, on a work of piety--the Chubara. That was full of brick cells, gaily\npainted with the figures of Gods and kings and elephants, where worn-out\npriests could sit and meditate on the latter end of things; the paths\nwere brick paved, and the naked feet of thousands had worn them into\ngutters. Clumps of mangoes sprouted from between the bricks; great\npipal trees overhung the well-windlass that whined all day; and hosts\nof parrots tore through the trees. Crows and squirrels were tame in that\nplace, for they knew that never a priest would touch them.\n\nThe wandering mendicants, charm-sellers, and holy vagabonds for a\nhundred miles round used to make the Chubara their place of call and\nrest. Mahomedan, Sikh, and Hindu mixed equally under the trees. They\nwere old men, and when man has come to the turnstiles of Night all the\ncreeds in the world seem to him wonderfully alike and colourless.\n\nGobind the one-eyed told me this. He was a holy man who lived on an\nisland in the middle of a river and fed the fishes with little bread\npellets twice a day. In flood-time, when swollen corpses stranded\nthemselves at the foot of the island, Gobind would cause them to be\npiously burned, for the sake of the honour of mankind, and having regard\nto his own account with God hereafter. But when two-thirds of the\nisland was torn away in a spate, Gobind came across the river to Dhunni\nBhagat\u2019s Chubara, he and his brass drinking vessel with the well-cord\nround the neck, his short arm-rest crutch studded with brass nails, his\nroll of bedding, his big pipe, his umbrella, and his tall sugar-loaf hat\nwith the nodding peacock feathers in it. He wrapped himself up in his\npatched quilt made of every colour and material in the world, sat down\nin a sunny corner of the very quiet Chubara, and, resting his arm on his\nshort-handled crutch, waited for death. The people brought him food and\nlittle clumps of marigold flowers, and he gave his blessing in return.\nHe was nearly blind, and his face was seamed and lined and wrinkled\nbeyond belief, for he had lived in his time which was before the English\ncame within five hundred miles of Dhunni Bhagat\u2019s Chubara.\n\nWhen we grew to know each other well, Gobind would tell me tales in a\nvoice most like the rumbling of heavy guns over a wooden bridge. His\ntales were true, but not one in twenty could be printed in an English\nbook, because the English do not think as natives do. They brood over\nmatters that a native would dismiss till a fitting occasion; and what\nthey would not think twice about a native will brood over till a fitting\noccasion: then native and English stare at each other hopelessly across\ngreat gulfs of miscomprehension."}

Here is\none more book that depicts the struggle of a human creature, under\nthose opposing influences of Good and Evil, which we have all felt,\nwhich we have all known. It has been my aim to make the character of\n\u201cMagdalen,\u201d which personifies this struggle, a pathetic character even\nin its perversity and its error; and I have tried hard to attain this\nresult by the least obtrusive and the least artificial of all means\u2014by\na resolute adherence throughout to the truth as it is in Nature. This\ndesign was no easy one to accomplish; and it has been a great\nencouragement to me (during the publication of my story in its\nperiodical form) to know, on the authority of many readers, that the\nobject which I had proposed to myself, I might, in some degree,\nconsider as an object achieved.\n\nRound the central figure in the narrative other characters will be\nfound grouped, in sharp contrast\u2014contrast, for the most part, in which\nI have endeavored to make the element of humor mainly predominant. I\nhave sought to impart this relief to the more serious passages in the\nbook, not only because I believe myself to be justified in doing so by\nthe laws of Art\u2014but because experience has taught me (what the\nexperience of my readers will doubtless confirm) that there is no such\nmoral phenomenon as unmixed tragedy to be found in the world around us.\nLook where we may, the dark threads and the light cross each other\nperpetually in the texture of human life.\n\nTo pass from the Characters to the Story, it will be seen that the\nnarrative related in these pages has been constructed on a plan which\ndiffers from the plan followed in my last novel, and in some other of\nmy works published at an earlier date. The only Secret contained in\nthis book is revealed midway in the first volume. From that point, all\nthe main events of the story are purposely foreshadowed before they\ntake place\u2014my present design being to rouse the reader\u2019s interest in\nfollowing the train of circumstances by which these foreseen events are\nbrought about. In trying this new ground, I am not turning my back in\ndoubt on the ground which I have passed over already. My one object in\nfollowing a new course is to enlarge the range of my studies in the art\nof writing fiction, and to vary the form in which I make my appeal to\nthe reader, as attractively as I can."}

Marian loved Big Mary, and meant to\nbe very good to her. But sometimes she was not.\n\nSanta Claus had brought Big Mary one snowy Christmas night, and\nhe had brought also a great many pretty clothes for her to wear.\nThere were three dresses, a warm red one for winter, and a white\none, very thin, for summer, and still another, of beautiful blue\nsilk with lace on it, for best.\n\nThen, also, there were little skirts, and tiny stockings, and\npretty little shoes with shiny buckles and real heels, and there\nwas a pink parasol, and, best of all, a dear little muff, made of\nsoft white fur, to keep Big Mary's hands warm in cold weather.\n\nAt first little Marian loved to dress Big Mary in all these\npretty things, and she would put on first the warm red dress, and\nthen the thin white one, and then the one of blue silk with the\nbeautiful lace. And she would raise the big parasol and put it\nover Big Mary's head. But she hardly ever gave Big Mary the\nlittle white muff to hold, because that was for very, _very_\nbest. Little Marian's own mamma had said so.\n\nBut when Marian's birthday came, grandma gave her a doll's trunk,\nand after that the days were not so pleasant for Big Mary. It was\nso much fun to pack the trunk that little Marian often took off\nall the clothes Big Mary had on to put them away in the trunk.\nMany a time poor Big Mary had to sit for hours all undressed, and\nshe would shiver and shake, until at last one time when little\nMarian had left her lying all night on the floor without any\nclothes on, she took a dreadful cold and became very ill.\n\nThen little Marian was very sorry for what she had done, and she\nput Big Mary to bed and sent for Dr. Prince. When the doctor came\nhe looked at Big Mary's tongue, and felt her pulse. And then he\nshook his head and looked very grave. He said that Big Mary must\ntake some medicine every day, and must sit out in the fresh air,\nand always wear her best clothes all the time; for she was a very\nsick doll indeed.\n\nSo little Marian dressed Big Mary in the blue silk trimmed with\nlace, because that was her very best dress, and she raised the\npink parasol and put it over her head and she gave Big Mary the\nwhite muff to hold, because that was for very, _very_ best. Then\nshe carried Big Mary out to the gray rock in the back yard where\nthe nasturtiums grow, to sit in the fresh air all day long."}

To\nrestore the grey carcases of a medi\u00e6valism whose spirit had fled,\nseemed a not less incongruous act than to set about renovating the\nadjoining crags themselves.\n\nHence it happened that an imaginary history of three human hearts,\nwhose emotions were not without correspondence with these material\ncircumstances, found in the ordinary incidents of such\nchurch-renovations a fitting frame for its presentation.\n\nThe shore and country about \u201cCastle Boterel\u201d is now getting well known,\nand will be readily recognized. The spot is, I may add, the furthest\nwestward of all those convenient corners wherein I have ventured to\nerect my theatre for these imperfect little dramas of country life and\npassions; and it lies near to, or no great way beyond, the vague border\nof the Wessex kingdom on that side, which, like the westering verge of\nmodern American settlements, was progressive and uncertain.\n\nThis, however, is of little importance. The place is pre-eminently (for\none person at least) the region of dream and mystery. The ghostly\nbirds, the pall-like sea, the frothy wind, the eternal soliloquy of the\nwaters, the bloom of dark purple cast, that seems to exhale from the\nshoreward precipices, in themselves lend to the scene an atmosphere\nlike the twilight of a night vision.\n\nOne enormous sea-bord cliff in particular figures in the narrative; and\nfor some forgotten reason or other this cliff was described in the\nstory as being without a name. Accuracy would require the statement to\nbe that a remarkable cliff which resembles in many points the cliff of\nthe description bears a name that no event has made famous.\n\nT.

I saw it in\nthe daylight, with the sun upon it.  There was no wind, no rain, no\nlightning, no thunder, no awful or unwonted circumstance, of any kind, to\nheighten its effect.  More than that: I had come to it direct from a\nrailway station: it was not more than a mile distant from the railway\nstation; and, as I stood outside the house, looking back upon the way I\nhad come, I could see the goods train running smoothly along the\nembankment in the valley.  I will not say that everything was utterly\ncommonplace, because I doubt if anything can be that, except to utterly\ncommonplace people\u2014and there my vanity steps in; but, I will take it on\nmyself to say that anybody might see the house as I saw it, any fine\nautumn morning.\n\nThe manner of my lighting on it was this.\n\nI was travelling towards London out of the North, intending to stop by\nthe way, to look at the house.  My health required a temporary residence\nin the country; and a friend of mine who knew that, and who had happened\nto drive past the house, had written to me to suggest it as a likely\nplace.  I had got into the train at midnight, and had fallen asleep, and\nhad woke up and had sat looking out of window at the brilliant Northern\nLights in the sky, and had fallen asleep again, and had woke up again to\nfind the night gone, with the usual discontented conviction on me that I\nhadn\u2019t been to sleep at all;\u2014upon which question, in the first imbecility\nof that condition, I am ashamed to believe that I would have done wager\nby battle with the man who sat opposite me.  That opposite man had had,\nthrough the night\u2014as that opposite man always has\u2014several legs too many,\nand all of them too long.  In addition to this unreasonable conduct\n(which was only to be expected of him), he had had a pencil and a\npocket-book, and had been perpetually listening and taking notes.  It had\nappeared to me that these aggravating notes related to the jolts and\nbumps of the carriage, and I should have resigned myself to his taking\nthem, under a general supposition that he was in the civil-engineering\nway of life, if he had not sat staring straight over my head whenever he\nlistened.  He was a goggle-eyed gentleman of a perplexed aspect, and his\ndemeanour became unbearable.\n\nIt was a cold, dead morning (the sun not being up yet), and when I had\nout-watched the paling light of the fires of the iron country, and the\ncurtain of heavy smoke that hung at once between me and the stars and\nbetween me and the day, I turned to my fellow-traveller and said:"}

The\nlife has been allowed to write itself in extracts from her letters and\njournals. Free from the obtrusion of any mind but her own, this method\nserves, I think, better than any other open to me, to show the\ndevelopment of her intellect and character.\n\nIn dealing with the correspondence I have been influenced by the\ndesire to make known the woman, as well as the author, through the\npresentation of her daily life.\n\nOn the intellectual side there remains little to be learned by those\nwho already know George Eliot's books. In the twenty volumes which she\nwrote and published in her lifetime will be found her best and ripest\nthoughts. The letters now published throw light on another side of her\nnature--not less important, but hitherto unknown to the public--the\nside of the affections.\n\nThe intimate life was the core of the root from which sprung the\nfairest flowers of her inspiration. Fame came to her late in life,\nand, when it presented itself, was so weighted with the sense of\nresponsibility that it was in truth a rose with many thorns, for\nGeorge Eliot had the temperament that shrinks from the position of a\npublic character. The belief in the wide, and I may add in the\nbeneficent, effect of her writing was no doubt the highest happiness,\nthe reward of the artist which she greatly cherished: but the joys of\nthe hearthside, the delight in the love of her friends, were the\nsupreme pleasures in her life."}

Alcott\n\nPreface\n\nAS a preface is the only place where an author can with propriety\nexplain a purpose or apologize for shortcomings, I venture to avail\nmyself of the privilege to make a statement for the benefit of my\nreaders.\n\nAs the first part of \u201cAn Old-Fashioned Girl\u201d was written in 1869, the\ndemand for a sequel, in beseeching little letters that made refusal\nimpossible, rendered it necessary to carry my heroine boldly forward\nsome six or seven years into the future. The domestic nature of the\nstory makes this audacious proceeding possible; while the lively fancies\nof my young readers will supply all deficiencies, and overlook all\ndiscrepancies.\n\nThis explanation will, I trust, relieve those well-regulated minds,\nwho cannot conceive of such literary lawlessness, from the bewilderment\nwhich they suffered when the same experiment was tried in a former book.\n\nThe \u201cOld-Fashioned Girl\u201d is not intended as a perfect model, but as\na possible improvement upon [Page] the Girl of the Period, who seems\nsorrowfully ignorant or ashamed of the good old fashions which make\nwoman truly beautiful and honored, and, through her, render home what\nit should be,-a happy place, where parents and children, brothers and\nsisters, learn to love and know and help one another.\n\nIf the history of Polly's girlish experiences suggests a hint or\ninsinuates a lesson, I shall feel that, in spite of many obstacles, I\nhave not entirely neglected my duty toward the little men and women, for\nwhom it is an honor and a pleasure to write, since in them I have always\nfound my kindest patrons, gentlest critics, warmest friends.\n\nL.

Should n't have a crimp left if I\nwent out such a day as this; and I want to look nice when Polly comes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don't expect me to go and bring home a strange girl alone, do you?\u201d\n And Tom looked as much alarmed as if his sister had proposed to him to\nescort the wild woman of Australia.\n\n\u201cOf course I do. It's your place to go and get her; and if you was n't\na bear, you'd like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I call that mean! I supposed I'd got to go; but you said you'd\ngo, too. Catch me bothering about your friends another time! No, sir!\u201d\n And Tom rose from the sofa with an air of indignant resolution, the\nimpressive effect of which was somewhat damaged by a tousled head, and\nthe hunched appearance of his garments generally."}

Thus, he\nwho has travelled far and seen much is apt to fancy that he has lived\nlong; and the history that most abounds in important incidents soonest\nassumes the aspect of antiquity. In no other way can we account for the\nvenerable air that is already gathering around American annals. When the\nmind reverts to the earliest days of colonial history, the period seems\nremote and obscure, the thousand changes that thicken along the links\nof recollections, throwing back the origin of the nation to a day so\ndistant as seemingly to reach the mists of time; and yet four lives of\nordinary duration would suffice to transmit, from mouth to mouth, in the\nform of tradition, all that civilized man has achieved within the\nlimits of the republic. Although New York alone possesses a population\nmaterially exceeding that of either of the four smallest kingdoms of\nEurope, or materially exceeding that of the entire Swiss Confederation,\nit is little more than two centuries since the Dutch commenced their\nsettlement, rescuing the region from the savage state. Thus, what seems\nvenerable by an accumulation of changes is reduced to familiarity when\nwe come seriously to consider it solely in connection with time.\n\nThis glance into the perspective of the past will prepare the reader to\nlook at the pictures we are about to sketch, with less surprise than he\nmight otherwise feel; and a few additional explanations may carry him\nback in imagination to the precise condition of society that we desire\nto delineate. It is matter of history that the settlements on the\neastern shores of the Hudson, such as Claverack, Kinderhook, and even\nPoughkeepsie, were not regarded as safe from Indian incursions a century\nsince; and there is still standing on the banks of the same river, and\nwithin musket-shot of the wharves of Albany, a residence of a younger\nbranch of the Van Rensselaers, that has loopholes constructed for\ndefence against the same crafty enemy, although it dates from a period\nscarcely so distant. Other similar memorials of the infancy of the\ncountry are to be found, scattered through what is now deemed the very\ncentre of American civilization, affording the plainest proofs that all\nwe possess of security from invasion and hostile violence is the growth\nof but little more than the time that is frequently fulfilled by a\nsingle human life."}

It wouldn't matter to any of them really,\"\nhe went on, \"for, even were it possible to meet in that stand-and-deliver\nway so silly a demand on so big a subject, my 'thoughts' would still be\nalmost altogether about something that concerns only myself.\"  He was\ntalking to Miss Staverton, with whom for a couple of months now he had\navailed himself of every possible occasion to talk; this disposition and\nthis resource, this comfort and support, as the situation in fact\npresented itself, having promptly enough taken the first place in the\nconsiderable array of rather unattenuated surprises attending his so\nstrangely belated return to America.  Everything was somehow a surprise;\nand that might be natural when one had so long and so consistently\nneglected everything, taken pains to give surprises so much margin for\nplay.  He had given them more than thirty years--thirty-three, to be\nexact; and they now seemed to him to have organised their performance\nquite on the scale of that licence.  He had been twenty-three on leaving\nNew York--he was fifty-six to-day; unless indeed he were to reckon as he\nhad sometimes, since his repatriation, found himself feeling; in which\ncase he would have lived longer than is often allotted to man.  It would\nhave taken a century, he repeatedly said to himself, and said also to\nAlice Staverton, it would have taken a longer absence and a more averted\nmind than those even of which he had been guilty, to pile up the\ndifferences, the newnesses, the queernesses, above all the bignesses, for\nthe better or the worse, that at present assaulted his vision wherever he\nlooked.\n\nThe great fact all the while, however, had been the incalculability;\nsince he _had_ supposed himself, from decade to decade, to be allowing,\nand in the most liberal and intelligent manner, for brilliancy of change.\nHe actually saw that he had allowed for nothing; he missed what he would\nhave been sure of finding, he found what he would never have imagined.\nProportions and values were upside-down; the ugly things he had expected,\nthe ugly things of his far-away youth, when he had too promptly waked up\nto a sense of the ugly--these uncanny phenomena placed him rather, as it\nhappened, under the charm; whereas the \"swagger\" things, the modern, the\nmonstrous, the famous things, those he had more particularly, like\nthousands of ingenuous enquirers every year, come over to see, were\nexactly his sources of dismay.  They were as so many set traps for\ndispleasure, above all for reaction, of which his restless tread was\nconstantly pressing the spring.  It was interesting, doubtless, the whole\nshow, but it would have been too disconcerting hadn't a certain finer\ntruth saved the situation.  He had distinctly not, in this steadier\nlight, come over _all_ for the monstrosities; he had come, not only in\nthe last analysis but quite on the face of the act, under an impulse with\nwhich they had nothing to do.  He had come--putting the thing\npompously--to look at his \"property,\" which he had thus for a third of a\ncentury not been within four thousand miles of; or, expressing it less\nsordidly, he had yielded to the humour of seeing again his house on the\njolly corner, as he usually, and quite fondly, described it--the one in\nwhich he had first seen the light, in which various members of his family\nhad lived and had died, in which the holidays of his overschooled boyhood\nhad been passed and the few social flowers of his chilled adolescence\ngathered, and which, alienated then for so long a period, had, through\nthe successive deaths of his two brothers and the termination of old\narrangements, come wholly into his hands.  He was the owner of another,\nnot quite so \"good\"--the jolly corner having been, from far back,\nsuperlatively extended and consecrated; and the value of the pair\nrepresented his main capital, with an income consisting, in these later\nyears, of their respective rents which (thanks precisely to their\noriginal excellent type) had never been depressingly low.  He could live\nin \"Europe,\" as he had been in the habit of living, on the product of\nthese flourishing New York leases, and all the better since, that of the\nsecond structure, the mere number in its long row, having within a\ntwelvemonth fallen in, renovation at a high advance had proved\nbeautifully possible."}

For this purpose, while ostensibly relating the adventures of a\nChair, he has endeavored to keep a distinct and unbroken thread of\nauthentic history. The Chair is made to pass from one to another of those\npersonages, of whom he thought it most desirable for the young reader to\nhave vivid and familiar ideas, and whose lives and actions would best\nenable him to give picturesque sketches of the times. On its sturdy oaken\nlegs, it trudges diligently from one scene to another, and seems always to\nthrust itself in the way, with most benign complacency, whenever a\nhistorical personage happens to be looking round for a seat.\n\nThere is certainly no method, by which the shadowy outlines of departed\nmen and women can he made to assume the hues of life more effectually,\nthan by connecting their images with the substantial and homely reality of\na fireside chair. It causes us to feel at once, that these characters of\nhistory had a private and familiar existence, and were not wholly\ncontained within that cold array of outward action, which we are compelled\nto receive as the adequate representation of their lives. If this\nimpression can be given, much is accomplished.\n\nSetting aside Grandfather and his auditors, and excepting the adventures\nof the Chair, which form the machinery of the work, nothing in the ensuing\npages can be termed fictitious. The author, it is true, has sometimes\nassumed the license of filling up the outline of history with details, for\nwhich he has none but imaginative authority, but which, he hopes, do not\nviolate nor give a false coloring to the truth. He believes that, in this\nrespect, his narrative will not be found to convey ideas and impressions,\nof which the reader may hereafter find it necessary to purge his mind."}

They were tired and weak,\nand their faces had the drawn expression of patience which comes of\nhardship long endured. They were heavily burdened with blanket packs\nwhich were strapped to their shoulders. Head-straps, passing across the\nforehead, helped support these packs. Each man carried a rifle. They\nwalked in a stooped posture, the shoulders well forward, the head still\nfarther forward, the eyes bent upon the ground.\n\n\"I wish we had just about two of them cartridges that's layin' in that\ncache of ourn,\" said the second man.\n\nHis voice was utterly and drearily expressionless. He spoke without\nenthusiasm; and the first man, limping into the milky stream that\nfoamed over the rocks, vouchsafed no reply.\n\nThe other man followed at his heels. They did not remove their\nfoot-gear, though the water was icy cold--so cold that their ankles\nached and their feet went numb. In places the water dashed against\ntheir knees, and both men staggered for footing.\n\nThe man who followed slipped on a smooth boulder, nearly fell, but\nrecovered himself with a violent effort, at the same time uttering a\nsharp exclamation of pain. He seemed faint and dizzy and put out his\nfree hand while he reeled, as though seeking support against the air.\nWhen he had steadied himself he stepped forward, but reeled again and\nnearly fell. Then he stood still and looked at the other man, who had\nnever turned his head.\n\nThe man stood still for fully a minute, as though debating with\nhimself. Then he called out:\n\n\"I say, Bill, I've sprained my ankle.\"\n\nBill staggered on through the milky water. He did not look around. The\nman watched him go, and though his face was expressionless as ever, his\neyes were like the eyes of a wounded deer.\n\nThe other man limped up the farther bank and continued straight on\nwithout looking back. The man in the stream watched him. His lips\ntrembled a little, so that the rough thatch of brown hair which covered\nthem was visibly agitated. His tongue even strayed out to moisten them.\n\n\"Bill!\" he cried out.\n\nIt was the pleading cry of a strong man in distress, but Bill's head\ndid not turn. The man watched him go, limping grotesquely and lurching\nforward with stammering gait up the slow slope toward the soft sky-line\nof the low-lying hill.

If the false view of life be destroyed this art will cease to\nappear valuable. Is it best to screen the error for the sake of\npreserving the art? Or should the art be sacrificed for the sake of\ntruthfulness?\n\nAgain and again in history a dominant church has utilised art to\nmaintain its sway over men. Reformers (early Christians, Mohammedans,\nPuritans, and others) have perceived that art bound people to the old\nfaith, and they were angry with art. They diligently chipped the noses\nfrom statues and images, and were wroth with ceremonies, decorations,\nstained-glass windows, and processions. They were even ready to banish\nart altogether, for, besides the superstitions it upheld, they saw that\nit depraved and perverted men by dramas, drinking-songs, novels,\npictures, and dances, of a kind that awakened man\u2019s lower nature. Yet\nart always reasserted her sway, and to-day we are told by many that art\nhas nothing to do with morality\u2014that \u201cart should be followed for art\u2019s\nsake.\u201d\n\nI went one day, with a lady artist, to the Bodkin Art Gallery in Moscow.\nIn one of the rooms, on a table, lay a book of coloured pictures, issued\nin Paris and supplied, I believe, to private subscribers only. The\npictures were admirably executed, but represented scenes in the private\ncabinets of a restaurant. Sexual indulgence was the chief subject of\neach picture. Women extravagantly dressed and partly undressed, women\nexposing their legs and breasts to men in evening dress; men and women\ntaking liberties with each other, or dancing the \u201ccan-can,\u201d etc., etc.\nMy companion the artist, a maiden lady of irreproachable conduct and\nreputation, began deliberately to look at these pictures. I could not\nlet my attention dwell on them without ill effects. Such things had a\ncertain attraction for me, and tended to make me restless and nervous. I\nventured to suggest that the subject-matter of the pictures was\nobjectionable. But my companion (who prided herself on being an artist)\nremarked with conscious superiority, that from an artist\u2019s point of view\nthe _subject_ was of no consequence. The pictures being very well\nexecuted were artistic, and therefore worthy of attention and study.\nMorality had nothing to do with art."}

Not being old enough to\ninvent, I content myself with narrating, and I beg the reader to assure\nhimself of the truth of a story in which all the characters, with the\nexception of the heroine, are still alive. Eye-witnesses of the greater\npart of the facts which I have collected are to be found in Paris, and\nI might call upon them to confirm me if my testimony is not enough.\nAnd, thanks to a particular circumstance, I alone can write these\nthings, for I alone am able to give the final details, without which it\nwould have been impossible to make the story at once interesting and\ncomplete.\n\nThis is how these details came to my knowledge. On the 12th of March,\n1847, I saw in the Rue Lafitte a great yellow placard announcing a sale\nof furniture and curiosities. The sale was to take place on account of\nthe death of the owner. The owner\u2019s name was not mentioned, but the\nsale was to be held at 9, Rue d\u2019Antin, on the 16th, from 12 to 5. The\nplacard further announced that the rooms and furniture could be seen on\nthe 13th and 14th.\n\nI have always been very fond of curiosities, and I made up my mind not\nto miss the occasion, if not of buying some, at all events of seeing\nthem. Next day I called at 9, Rue d\u2019Antin.\n\nIt was early in the day, and yet there were already a number of\nvisitors, both men and women, and the women, though they were dressed\nin cashmere and velvet, and had their carriages waiting for them at the\ndoor, gazed with astonishment and admiration at the luxury which they\nsaw before them.\n\nI was not long in discovering the reason of this astonishment and\nadmiration, for, having begun to examine things a little carefully, I\ndiscovered without difficulty that I was in the house of a kept woman.\nNow, if there is one thing which women in society would like to see\n(and there were society women there), it is the home of those women\nwhose carriages splash their own carriages day by day, who, like them,\nside by side with them, have their boxes at the Opera and at the\nItaliens, and who parade in Paris the opulent insolence of their\nbeauty, their diamonds, and their scandal.\n\nThis one was dead, so the most virtuous of women could enter even her\nbedroom. Death had purified the air of this abode of splendid foulness,\nand if more excuse were needed, they had the excuse that they had\nmerely come to a sale, they knew not whose. They had read the placards,\nthey wished to see what the placards had announced, and to make their\nchoice beforehand. What could be more natural? Yet, all the same, in\nthe midst of all these beautiful things, they could not help looking\nabout for some traces of this courtesan\u2019s life, of which they had\nheard, no doubt, strange enough stories."}

Starting with the heroic figure of Alexander the\nGreat, it inspects the dynasty of the Ptolemies, and in particular the\ncareer of the last of them, Cleopatra; an account of Ptolemaic\nliterature and science follows, and closes this splendid period, to\nwhich I have given the title of \u201cGreco-Egyptian.\u201d The second period,\ncalled \u201cChristian\u201d, begins with the rule of Rome, and traces the\nfortunes of Christianity, first as a persecuted and then as a\npersecuting power: all is lost in 641, when the Patriarch Cyrus betrays\nAlexandria to the Arabs. An interlude comes next\u2014\u201cThe Spiritual\nCity\u201d\u2014which meditates upon Alexandrian philosophy and religion, both\nPagan and Christian: it seemed better to segregate these subjects,\npartly because they interrupt the main historical procession, partly\nbecause many readers are not interested in them. History is resumed in\nthe \u201cArab Period,\u201d which is of no importance though it lasts over 1,000\nyears\u2014from Amr to Napoleon. With Napoleon begins the \u201cModern Period,\u201d\nthe main feature of which is the building of the city we now see under\nthe auspices of Mohammed Ali; and the pageant concludes, as well as it\nmay, with an account of the events of 1882, and with surmises as to\nfuture municipal developments.\n\nThe \u201cHistory\u201d is written in short sections, and at the end of each\nsection are references to the second part\u2014the \u201cGuide\u201d. _On these\nreferences the chief utility of the book depends_, so the reader is\nbegged to take special note of them: they may help him to link the\npresent and the past. Suppose, for instance, he has read in the History\nabout the Pharos: at the end of the section he will find references to\nFort Kait Bey where the Pharos stood, to Abousir where there is a\nminiature replica of it, and to the Coin Room in the Museum, where it\nappears on the moneys of Domitian and Hadrian. Or again, suppose that\nthe tragic fate of Hypatia has touched him: at the end will be\nreferences to the Caesareum, where Hypatia was murdered, and to the Wady\nNatrun, where the monks who murdered her generally resided. Or the\nBritish victories of 1801: he will be referred to the country over which\nour troops marched, to the Abercrombie Monument at Sidi Gaber, and to a\ntombstone in the courtyard of the Greek Patriarchate. The \u201csights\u201d of\nAlexandria are in themselves not interesting, but they fascinate when we\napproach them through the past, and this is what I have tried to do by\nthe double arrangement of History and Guide."}

To the left a group of barren islets, suggesting\nruins of stone walls, towers, and blockhouses, had its foundations set\nin a blue sea that itself looked solid, so still and stable did it lie\nbelow my feet; even the track of light from the westering sun shone\nsmoothly, without that animated glitter which tells of an imperceptible\nripple. And when I turned my head to take a parting glance at the tug\nwhich had just left us anchored outside the bar, I saw the straight line\nof the flat shore joined to the stable sea, edge to edge, with a perfect\nand unmarked closeness, in one leveled floor half brown, half blue under\nthe enormous dome of the sky. Corresponding in their insignificance to\nthe islets of the sea, two small clumps of trees, one on each side of\nthe only fault in the impeccable joint, marked the mouth of the river\nMeinam we had just left on the first preparatory stage of our homeward\njourney; and, far back on the inland level, a larger and loftier mass,\nthe grove surrounding the great Paknam pagoda, was the only thing on\nwhich the eye could rest from the vain task of exploring the monotonous\nsweep of the horizon. Here and there gleams as of a few scattered pieces\nof silver marked the windings of the great river; and on the nearest of\nthem, just within the bar, the tug steaming right into the land became\nlost to my sight, hull and funnel and masts, as though the impassive\nearth had swallowed her up without an effort, without a tremor. My eye\nfollowed the light cloud of her smoke, now here, now there, above the\nplain, according to the devious curves of the stream, but always fainter\nand farther away, till I lost it at last behind the miter-shaped hill\nof the great pagoda. And then I was left alone with my ship, anchored at\nthe head of the Gulf of Siam.\n\nShe floated at the starting point of a long journey, very still in an\nimmense stillness, the shadows of her spars flung far to the eastward by\nthe setting sun. At that moment I was alone on her decks. There was not\na sound in her--and around us nothing moved, nothing lived, not a canoe\non the water, not a bird in the air, not a cloud in the sky. In this\nbreathless pause at the threshold of a long passage we seemed to be\nmeasuring our fitness for a long and arduous enterprise, the appointed\ntask of both our existences to be carried out, far from all human eyes,\nwith only sky and sea for spectators and for judges."}

We cannot divide it by seasons.\nWe can only record its moods, and chronicle their return.  With us time\nitself does not progress.  It revolves.  It seems to circle round one\ncentre of pain.  The paralysing immobility of a life every circumstance\nof which is regulated after an unchangeable pattern, so that we eat and\ndrink and lie down and pray, or kneel at least for prayer, according to\nthe inflexible laws of an iron formula: this immobile quality, that makes\neach dreadful day in the very minutest detail like its brother, seems to\ncommunicate itself to those external forces the very essence of whose\nexistence is ceaseless change.  Of seed-time or harvest, of the reapers\nbending over the corn, or the grape gatherers threading through the\nvines, of the grass in the orchard made white with broken blossoms or\nstrewn with fallen fruit: of these we know nothing and can know nothing.\n\nFor us there is only one season, the season of sorrow.  The very sun and\nmoon seem taken from us.  Outside, the day may be blue and gold, but the\nlight that creeps down through the thickly-muffled glass of the small\niron-barred window beneath which one sits is grey and niggard.  It is\nalways twilight in one's cell, as it is always twilight in one's heart.\nAnd in the sphere of thought, no less than in the sphere of time, motion\nis no more.  The thing that you personally have long ago forgotten, or\ncan easily forget, is happening to me now, and will happen to me again to-\nmorrow.  Remember this, and you will be able to understand a little of\nwhy I am writing, and in this manner writing. . . .\n\nA week later, I am transferred here.  Three more months go over and my\nmother dies.  No one knew how deeply I loved and honoured her.  Her death\nwas terrible to me; but I, once a lord of language, have no words in\nwhich to express my anguish and my shame.  She and my father had\nbequeathed me a name they had made noble and honoured, not merely in\nliterature, art, archaeology, and science, but in the public history of\nmy own country, in its evolution as a nation.  I had disgraced that name\neternally.  I had made it a low by-word among low people.  I had dragged\nit through the very mire.  I had given it to brutes that they might make\nit brutal, and to fools that they might turn it into a synonym for folly.\nWhat I suffered then, and still suffer, is not for pen to write or paper\nto record.  My wife, always kind and gentle to me, rather than that I\nshould hear the news from indifferent lips, travelled, ill as she was,\nall the way from Genoa to England to break to me herself the tidings of\nso irreparable, so irremediable, a loss.  Messages of sympathy reached me\nfrom all who had still affection for me.  Even people who had not known\nme personally, hearing that a new sorrow had broken into my life, wrote\nto ask that some expression of their condolence should be conveyed to me.\n. . ."}

Sir Francis Starts It\n\nIt began to happen a long time ago, centuries ago, when, in a fragrant\nrush of rain, spring came one day to Punagwandah, fairest of the Channel\nIslands. Beneath the golden mists of sunrise danced a radiant sea. On\nsteeply sloping hillsides where thickets of wild lilac bloomed, the lark\nshook from his tiny throat a tumult of glad music. In shadowed niches of\nthe canyons lilies waited to fill with light their gleaming ivory cups.\nSpring in very truth was there.\n\nAnd looking down upon it from her cavern bower high above the beach,\nwatched the Princess Wildenai. Kneeling there, the light of dawn shining\non her long black hair, she was, herself, the sweetest blossom of the\nspring. Loveliest was she among all the maidens of the Mariposa and of\nroyal blood besides; although of this the great chief Torquam, who even\nat that moment lay sleeping in his lodge of deerskin on the crescent\nbeach below, knew more than he had ever told.\n\nWith eyes rapt, her breath scarcely stirring the folds of softest\nfawnskin drawn across her breast, the princess bent her gaze to where\nthe waves ran silver on the ocean's distant rim. There she knew the sun\nmust rise and, as the first dazzling ray sparkled across the water, she\nrose slowly until she stood erect, a slender, graceful figure against\nthe dim, gray rocks, and stretching her arms toward the East, spoke in\nthe musical words of her people.\n\n\u201cOh, Waken-ate, great spirit-father,\u201d she pleaded, \u201chave mercy on me.\nGrant to me, thy humble daughter, one only boon. Grant, I pray thee,\nthat it need not be I wed with Torquam's friend, the pale-face stranger.\nWell knowest thou I would not disobey my father, him the bravest and\nmost powerful of all thy warriors, him whom his people delight to honor,\nand whom I strive to please. All the more I feel my duty since, many\nmoons ago, they laid my mother underneath the flowers. Yet, even so, I\ncannot find it in my heart to wed with Don Cabrillo, dearly as does\nmy father wish it. Can'st thou not then, in thy great power, turn his\nheart, oh lord of spirits, that he no longer may desire it? Help me in\nthis, my only trial, I pray thee, and in all else will I be indeed his\nloyal daughter,--in all else save alone in this one thing!\u201d\n\nHer arms fell. Slowly she sank again to her knees, bending her head\nuntil her forehead touched the ground. For many minutes she lay thus\nprostrate while the glory of the rising sun bathed the sea in splendor.\nYet, when at last she rose, her eyes were dim with tears.\n\nBut now from the beach below there drifted up to her the sounds of a\nvillage astir. Shrill voices of women mingled with the crackling of\nfreshly kindled fires. A canoe, pushed hastily into the water, grated\nharshly on the pebbles. Still the maiden did not stir. Leaning against\nthe rocky ledge, her chin in her hands, she gazed listlessly out over\nthe shining sea. If any interests lived for her among the dark-skinned\npeople beneath the cliffs, for the moment at least she gave no sign."}

The door creaked on its hinges as a second old man\nentered, more bent, more wrinkled, more aged even than the first. He\nsupported himself by the help of a crutch, his eyes were covered by\na shade, and his lower lip, half averted, hung pale and pink from his\ndecaying yellow teeth. He made straight for an armchair on the opposite\nside of the table, sat down clumsily, and began to cough. The man with\nthe withered hand gave the newcomer a short glance of positive dislike;\nthe old woman took no notice of his arrival, but remained with her eyes\nfixed steadily on the fire.\n\n\u201cI said--it\u2019s your own choosing,\u201d said the man with the withered hand,\nwhen the coughing had ceased for a while.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my own choosing,\u201d I answered.\n\nThe man with the shade became aware of my presence for the first time,\nand threw his head back for a moment, and sidewise, to see me. I caught\na momentary glimpse of his eyes, small and bright and inflamed. Then he\nbegan to cough and splutter again.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you drink?\u201d said the man with the withered arm, pushing the\nbeer toward him. The man with the shade poured out a glassful with a\nshaking hand, that splashed half as much again on the deal table. A\nmonstrous shadow of him crouched upon the wall, and mocked his action\nas he poured and drank. I must confess I had scarcely expected these\ngrotesque custodians. There is, to my mind, something inhuman in\nsenility, something crouching and atavistic; the human qualities seem\nto drop from old people insensibly day by day. The three of them made me\nfeel uncomfortable with their gaunt silences, their bent carriage,\ntheir evident unfriendliness to me and to one another. And that night,\nperhaps, I was in the mood for uncomfortable impressions. I resolved to\nget away from their vague fore-shadowings of the evil things upstairs."}

He leaned upon his hand, with his untasted\nbreakfast before him, and he stared at the slip of paper which he had\njust drawn from its envelope. Then he took the envelope itself, held it\nup to the light, and very carefully studied both the exterior and the\nflap.\n\n\u201cIt is Porlock\u2019s writing,\u201d said he thoughtfully. \u201cI can hardly doubt\nthat it is Porlock\u2019s writing, though I have seen it only twice before.\nThe Greek e with the peculiar top flourish is distinctive. But if it is\nPorlock, then it must be something of the very first importance.\u201d\n\nHe was speaking to himself rather than to me; but my vexation\ndisappeared in the interest which the words awakened.\n\n\u201cWho then is Porlock?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cPorlock, Watson, is a nom-de-plume, a mere identification mark; but\nbehind it lies a shifty and evasive personality. In a former letter he\nfrankly informed me that the name was not his own, and defied me ever\nto trace him among the teeming millions of this great city. Porlock is\nimportant, not for himself, but for the great man with whom he is in\ntouch. Picture to yourself the pilot fish with the shark, the jackal\nwith the lion\u2014anything that is insignificant in companionship with what\nis formidable: not only formidable, Watson, but sinister\u2014in the highest\ndegree sinister. That is where he comes within my purview. You have\nheard me speak of Professor Moriarty?\u201d"}

Their eyes glanced level, and\nwere fastened upon the waves that swept toward them. These waves were\nof the hue of slate, save for the tops, which were of foaming white,\nand all of the men knew the colours of the sea. The horizon narrowed\nand widened, and dipped and rose, and at all times its edge was jagged\nwith waves that seemed thrust up in points like rocks.\n\nMany a man ought to have a bath-tub larger than the boat which here\nrode upon the sea. These waves were most wrongfully and barbarously\nabrupt and tall, and each froth-top was a problem in small boat\nnavigation.\n\nThe cook squatted in the bottom and looked with both eyes at the six\ninches of gunwale which separated him from the ocean. His sleeves were\nrolled over his fat forearms, and the two flaps of his unbuttoned vest\ndangled as he bent to bail out the boat. Often he said: \"Gawd! That was\na narrow clip.\" As he remarked it he invariably gazed eastward over the\nbroken sea.\n\nThe oiler, steering with one of the two oars in the boat, sometimes\nraised himself suddenly to keep clear of water that swirled in over the\nstern. It was a thin little oar and it seemed often ready to snap."}

Squire Hawkins sat upon the pyramid of large blocks, called\nthe \u201cstile,\u201d in front of his house, contemplating the morning.\n\nThe locality was Obedstown, East Tennessee. You would not know that\nObedstown stood on the top of a mountain, for there was nothing about\nthe landscape to indicate it--but it did: a mountain that stretched\nabroad over whole counties, and rose very gradually. The district\nwas called the \u201cKnobs of East Tennessee,\u201d and had a reputation like\nNazareth, as far as turning out any good thing was concerned.\n\nThe Squire's house was a double log cabin, in a state of decay; two\nor three gaunt hounds lay asleep about the threshold, and lifted their\nheads sadly whenever Mrs. Hawkins or the children stepped in and out\nover their bodies. Rubbish was scattered about the grassless yard; a\nbench stood near the door with a tin wash basin on it and a pail of\nwater and a gourd; a cat had begun to drink from the pail, but the\nexertion was overtaxing her energies, and she had stopped to rest. There\nwas an ash-hopper by the fence, and an iron pot, for soft-soap-boiling,\nnear it.\n\nThis dwelling constituted one-fifteenth of Obedstown; the other fourteen\nhouses were scattered about among the tall pine trees and among the\ncorn-fields in such a way that a man might stand in the midst of the\ncity and not know but that he was in the country if he only depended on\nhis eyes for information."}

I have lately been subject to attacks of\n_angina pectoris_; and in the ordinary course of things, my physician\ntells me, I may fairly hope that my life will not be protracted\nmany months. Unless, then, I am cursed with an exceptional physical\nconstitution, as I am cursed with an exceptional mental character, I\nshall not much longer groan under the wearisome burthen of this earthly\nexistence. If it were to be otherwise--if I were to live on to the age\nmost men desire and provide for--I should for once have known whether\nthe miseries of delusive expectation can outweigh the miseries of true\nprevision. For I foresee when I shall die, and everything that will\nhappen in my last moments.\n\nJust a month from this day, on September 20, 1850, I shall be sitting\nin this chair, in this study, at ten o'clock at night, longing to die,\nweary of incessant insight and foresight, without delusions and without\nhope. Just as I am watching a tongue of blue flame rising in the fire,\nand my lamp is burning low, the horrible contraction will begin at my\nchest. I shall only have time to reach the bell, and pull it violently,\nbefore the sense of suffocation will come. No one will answer my bell.\nI know why. My two servants are lovers, and will have quarrelled. My\nhousekeeper will have rushed out of the house in a fury, two hours\nbefore, hoping that Perry will believe she has gone to drown herself.\nPerry is alarmed at last, and is gone out after her. The little\nscullery-maid is asleep on a bench: she never answers the bell; it does\nnot wake her. The sense of suffocation increases: my lamp goes out with\na horrible stench: I make a great effort, and snatch at the bell again.\nI long for life, and there is no help. I thirsted for the unknown:\nthe thirst is gone. O God, let me stay with the known, and be weary\nof it: I am content. Agony of pain and suffocation--and all the while\nthe earth, the fields, the pebbly brook at the bottom of the rookery,\nthe fresh scent after the rain, the light of the morning through my\nchamber-window, the warmth of the hearth after the frosty air--will\ndarkness close over them for ever?\n\nDarkness--darkness--no pain--nothing but darkness: but I am passing\non and on through the darkness: my thought stays in the darkness, but\nalways with a sense of moving onward . . .\n\nBefore that time comes, I wish to use my last hours of ease and\nstrength in telling the strange story of my experience. I have never\nfully unbosomed myself to any human being; I have never been encouraged\nto trust much in the sympathy of my fellow-men. But we have all a\nchance of meeting with some pity, some tenderness, some charity, when\nwe are dead: it is the living only who cannot be forgiven--the living\nonly from whom men's indulgence and reverence are held off, like the\nrain by the hard east wind. While the heart beats, bruise it--it is\nyour only opportunity; while the eye can still turn towards you with\nmoist, timid entreaty, freeze it with an icy unanswering gaze; while\nthe ear, that delicate messenger to the inmost sanctuary of the soul,\ncan still take in the tones of kindness, put it off with hard civility,\nor sneering compliment, or envious affectation of indifference; while\nthe creative brain can still throb with the sense of injustice,\nwith the yearning for brotherly recognition--make haste--oppress it\nwith your ill-considered judgements, your trivial comparisons, your\ncareless misrepresentations. The heart will by and by be still--\"ubi\nsaeva indignatio ulterius cor lacerare nequit\"; the eye will cease to\nentreat; the ear will be deaf; the brain will have ceased from all\nwants as well as from all work. Then your charitable speeches may find\nvent; then you may remember and pity the toil and the struggle and the\nfailure; then you may give due honour to the work achieved; then you\nmay find extenuation for errors, and may consent to bury them."}

She has known the\nway to the hearts of young people, not only in her own class, or even\ncountry, but in every condition of life, and in many foreign lands.\nPlato says, \"Beware of those who teach fables to children;\" and it is\nimpossible to estimate the influence which the popular writer of\nfiction has over the audience he wins to listen to his tales. The\npreacher, the teacher, the didactic writer find their audience in\nhours of strength, with critical faculties all alive, to question\ntheir propositions and refute their arguments. The novelist comes to\nus in the intervals of recreation and relaxation, and by his seductive\npowers of imagination and sentiment takes possession of the fancy and\nthe heart before judgment and reason are aroused to defend the\ncitadel. It well becomes us, then, who would guard young minds from\nsubtle temptations, to study the character of those works which charm\nand delight the children.\n\nOf no author can it be more truly said than of Louisa Alcott that her\nworks are a revelation of herself. She rarely sought for the material\nof her stories in old chronicles, or foreign adventures. Her capital\nwas her own life and experiences and those of others directly about\nher; and her own well-remembered girlish frolics and fancies were sure\nto find responsive enjoyment in the minds of other girls.\n\nIt is therefore impossible to understand Miss Alcott's works fully\nwithout a knowledge of her own life and experiences. By inheritance\nand education she had rich and peculiar gifts; and her life was one of\nrare advantages, as well as of trying difficulties. Herself of the\nmost true and frank nature, she has given us the opportunity of\nknowing her without disguise; and it is thus that I shall try to\nportray her, showing what influences acted upon her through life, and\nhow faithfully and fully she performed whatever duties circumstances\nlaid upon her. Fortunately I can let her speak mainly for herself.\n\nMiss Alcott revised her journals at different times during her later\nlife, striking out what was too personal for other eyes than her own,\nand destroying a great deal which would doubtless have proved very\ninteresting."}

Work was cheap, but bread was dear, and what he\nearned he spent for food. The man and his wife had but one sheepskin\ncoat between them for winter wear, and even that was torn to tatters,\nand this was the second year he had been wanting to buy sheep-skins for\na new coat. Before winter Simon saved up a little money: a three-rouble\nnote lay hidden in his wife's box, and five roubles and twenty kopeks\nwere owed him by customers in the village.\n\nSo one morning he prepared to go to the village to buy the sheep-skins.\nHe put on over his shirt his wife's wadded nankeen jacket, and over that\nhe put his own cloth coat. He took the three-rouble note in his\npocket, cut himself a stick to serve as a staff, and started off after\nbreakfast. \"I'll collect the five roubles that are due to me,\"\nthought he, \"add the three I have got, and that will be enough to buy\nsheep-skins for the winter coat.\"\n\nHe came to the village and called at a peasant's hut, but the man was\nnot at home. The peasant's wife promised that the money should be\npaid next week, but she would not pay it herself. Then Simon called on\nanother peasant, but this one swore he had no money, and would only pay\ntwenty kopeks which he owed for a pair of boots Simon had mended. Simon\nthen tried to buy the sheep-skins on credit, but the dealer would not\ntrust him.\n\n\"Bring your money,\" said he, \"then you may have your pick of the skins.\nWe know what debt-collecting is like.\" So all the business the shoemaker\ndid was to get the twenty kopeks for boots he had mended, and to take a\npair of felt boots a peasant gave him to sole with leather."}

In the\nsummer I often leave home early in the morning, and roam about fields\nand lanes all day, or even escape for days or weeks together; but,\nsaving in the country, I seldom go out until after dark, though, Heaven\nbe thanked, I love its light and feel the cheerfulness it sheds upon the\nearth, as much as any creature living.\n\nI have fallen insensibly into this habit, both because it favours my\ninfirmity and because it affords me greater opportunity of speculating\non the characters and occupations of those who fill the streets. The\nglare and hurry of broad noon are not adapted to idle pursuits like\nmine; a glimpse of passing faces caught by the light of a street-lamp\nor a shop window is often better for my purpose than their full\nrevelation in the daylight; and, if I must add the truth, night is\nkinder in this respect than day, which too often destroys an air-built\ncastle at the moment of its completion, without the least ceremony or\nremorse.\n\nThat constant pacing to and fro, that never-ending restlessness, that\nincessant tread of feet wearing the rough stones smooth and glossy--is\nit not a wonder how the dwellers in narrows ways can bear to hear it!\nThink of a sick man in such a place as Saint Martin\u2019s Court, listening\nto the footsteps, and in the midst of pain and weariness obliged,\ndespite himself (as though it were a task he must perform) to detect\nthe child\u2019s step from the man\u2019s, the slipshod beggar from the booted\nexquisite, the lounging from the busy, the dull heel of the sauntering\noutcast from the quick tread of an expectant pleasure-seeker--think of\nthe hum and noise always being present to his sense, and of the stream\nof life that will not stop, pouring on, on, on, through all his\nrestless dreams, as if he were condemned to lie, dead but conscious, in\na noisy churchyard, and had no hope of rest for centuries to come.\n\nThen, the crowds forever passing and repassing on the bridges (on\nthose which are free of toll at least), where many stop on fine evenings\nlooking listlessly down upon the water with some vague idea that by and\nby it runs between green banks which grow wider and wider until at last\nit joins the broad vast sea--where some halt to rest from heavy loads\nand think as they look over the parapet that to smoke and lounge away\none\u2019s life, and lie sleeping in the sun upon a hot tarpaulin, in a\ndull, slow, sluggish barge, must be happiness unalloyed--and where\nsome, and a very different class, pause with heavier loads than they,\nremembering to have heard or read in old time that drowning was not a\nhard death, but of all means of suicide the easiest and best."}

It was she who invented the\nshort cut, who severed the Gordian knot. It is not supposed to be the\nnature of women to rise as a general thing to the largest and most\nliberal view--I mean of a practical scheme; but it has struck me that\nthey sometimes throw off a bold conception--such as a man would not have\nrisen to--with singular serenity. \u201cSimply ask them to take you in on the\nfooting of a lodger\u201d--I don\u2019t think that unaided I should have risen to\nthat. I was beating about the bush, trying to be ingenious, wondering\nby what combination of arts I might become an acquaintance, when she\noffered this happy suggestion that the way to become an acquaintance was\nfirst to become an inmate. Her actual knowledge of the Misses Bordereau\nwas scarcely larger than mine, and indeed I had brought with me from\nEngland some definite facts which were new to her. Their name had been\nmixed up ages before with one of the greatest names of the century, and\nthey lived now in Venice in obscurity, on very small means, unvisited,\nunapproachable, in a dilapidated old palace on an out-of-the-way canal:\nthis was the substance of my friend\u2019s impression of them. She herself\nhad been established in Venice for fifteen years and had done a great\ndeal of good there; but the circle of her benevolence did not include\nthe two shy, mysterious and, as it was somehow supposed, scarcely\nrespectable Americans (they were believed to have lost in their long\nexile all national quality, besides having had, as their name implied,\nsome French strain in their origin), who asked no favors and desired no\nattention. In the early years of her residence she had made an attempt\nto see them, but this had been successful only as regards the little\none, as Mrs. Prest called the niece; though in reality as I afterward\nlearned she was considerably the bigger of the two. She had heard Miss\nBordereau was ill and had a suspicion that she was in want; and she had\ngone to the house to offer assistance, so that if there were suffering\n(and American suffering), she should at least not have it on her\nconscience. The \u201clittle one\u201d received her in the great cold, tarnished\nVenetian sala, the central hall of the house, paved with marble and\nroofed with dim crossbeams, and did not even ask her to sit down. This\nwas not encouraging for me, who wished to sit so fast, and I remarked\nas much to Mrs. Prest. She however replied with profundity, \u201cAh, but\nthere\u2019s all the difference: I went to confer a favor and you will go\nto ask one. If they are proud you will be on the right side.\u201d And she\noffered to show me their house to begin with--to row me thither in her\ngondola. I let her know that I had already been to look at it half a\ndozen times; but I accepted her invitation, for it charmed me to hover\nabout the place. I had made my way to it the day after my arrival in\nVenice (it had been described to me in advance by the friend in England\nto whom I owed definite information as to their possession of the\npapers), and I had besieged it with my eyes while I considered my plan\nof campaign. Jeffrey Aspern had never been in it that I knew of;\nbut some note of his voice seemed to abide there by a roundabout\nimplication, a faint reverberation."}

I was just a girl in the village\nschool, when, one day, your grandmother came in to ask the mistress if\nthere was any scholar there who would do for a nurse-maid; and mighty\nproud I was, I can tell ye, when the mistress called me up, and spoke\nof me being a good girl at my needle, and a steady, honest girl, and\none whose parents were very respectable, though they might be poor. I\nthought I should like nothing better than to serve the pretty young\nlady, who was blushing as deep as I was, as she spoke of the coming\nbaby, and what I should have to do with it. However, I see you don't\ncare so much for this part of my story, as for what you think is to\ncome, so I'll tell you at once. I was engaged and settled at the\nparsonage before Miss Rosamond (that was the baby, who is now your\nmother) was born. To be sure, I had little enough to do with her when\nshe came, for she was never out of her mother's arms, and slept by her\nall night long; and proud enough was I sometimes when missis trusted\nher to me. There never was such a baby before or since, though you've\nall of you been fine enough in your turns; but for sweet, winning ways,\nyou've none of you come up to your mother. She took after her mother,\nwho was a real lady born; a Miss Furnivall, a grand-daughter of Lord\nFurnivall's, in Northumberland. I believe she had neither brother nor\nsister, and had been brought up in my lord's family till she had\nmarried your grandfather, who was just a curate, son to a shopkeeper in\nCarlisle--but a clever, fine gentleman as ever was--and one who was a\nright-down hard worker in his parish, which was very wide, and\nscattered all abroad over the Westmoreland Fells. When your mother,\nlittle Miss Rosamond, was about four or five years old, both her\nparents died in a fortnight--one after the other. Ah! that was a sad\ntime. My pretty young mistress and me was looking for another baby,\nwhen my master came home from one of his long rides, wet and tired, and\ntook the fever he died of; and then she never held up her head again,\nbut just lived to see her dead baby, and have it laid on her breast,\nbefore she sighed away her life. My mistress had asked me, on her\ndeath-bed, never to leave Miss Rosamond; but if she had never spoken a\nword, I would have gone with the little child to the end of the world."}

If\nanything could have driven me from Gladys, it would have been the\nthought of such a father-in-law.  I am convinced that he really\nbelieved in his heart that I came round to the Chestnuts three days a\nweek for the pleasure of his company, and very especially to hear his\nviews upon bimetallism, a subject upon which he was by way of being an\nauthority.\n\nFor an hour or more that evening I listened to his monotonous chirrup\nabout bad money driving out good, the token value of silver, the\ndepreciation of the rupee, and the true standards of exchange.\n\n\"Suppose,\" he cried with feeble violence, \"that all the debts in the\nworld were called up simultaneously, and immediate payment insisted\nupon,--what under our present conditions would happen then?\"\n\nI gave the self-evident answer that I should be a ruined man, upon\nwhich he jumped from his chair, reproved me for my habitual levity,\nwhich made it impossible for him to discuss any reasonable subject in\nmy presence, and bounced off out of the room to dress for a Masonic\nmeeting.\n\nAt last I was alone with Gladys, and the moment of Fate had come!  All\nthat evening I had felt like the soldier who awaits the signal which\nwill send him on a forlorn hope; hope of victory and fear of repulse\nalternating in his mind.\n\nShe sat with that proud, delicate profile of hers outlined against the\nred curtain.  How beautiful she was!  And yet how aloof!  We had been\nfriends, quite good friends; but never could I get beyond the same\ncomradeship which I might have established with one of my\nfellow-reporters upon the Gazette,--perfectly frank, perfectly kindly,\nand perfectly unsexual.  My instincts are all against a woman being too\nfrank and at her ease with me.  It is no compliment to a man.  Where\nthe real sex feeling begins, timidity and distrust are its companions,\nheritage from old wicked days when love and violence went often hand in\nhand.  The bent head, the averted eye, the faltering voice, the wincing\nfigure--these, and not the unshrinking gaze and frank reply, are the\ntrue signals of passion.  Even in my short life I had learned as much\nas that--or had inherited it in that race memory which we call instinct."}

He was fourteen minutes behind\ntime, and the throttle was wide open. In consequence, when he swung\naround the curve at the flower-bed, a wheel of his cart destroyed a\npeony. Number 36 slowed down at once and looked guiltily at his\nfather, who was mowing the lawn. The doctor had his back to this\naccident, and he continued to pace slowly to and fro, pushing the\nmower.\n\nJim dropped the tongue of the cart. He looked at his father and at the\nbroken flower. Finally he went to the peony and tried to stand it on\nits pins, resuscitated, but the spine of it was hurt, and it would\nonly hang limply from his hand. Jim could do no reparation. He looked\nagain towards his father.\n\nHe went on to the lawn, very slowly, and kicking wretchedly at the\nturf. Presently his father came along with the whirring machine, while\nthe sweet, new grass blades spun from the knives. In a low voice, Jim\nsaid, \"Pa!\"\n\nThe doctor was shaving this lawn as if it were a priest's chin. All\nduring the season he had worked at it in the coolness and peace of the\nevenings after supper. Even in the shadow of the cherry-trees the\ngrass was strong and healthy. Jim raised his voice a trifle. \"Pa!\"\n\nThe doctor paused, and with the howl of the machine no longer\noccupying the sense, one could hear the robins in the cherry-trees\narranging their affairs. Jim's hands were behind his back, and\nsometimes his fingers clasped and unclasped. Again he said, \"Pa!\" The\nchild's fresh and rosy lip was lowered."}

He was of a fat habit, even from boyhood, and inclined\nto a cheerful and cursory reading of the face of life; and possibly this\nattitude of mind was the original cause of his misfortunes.  Beyond this\nhint philosophy is silent on his career, and superstition steps in with\nthe more ready explanation that he was detested of the gods.\n\nHis father\u2014that iron gentleman\u2014had long ago enthroned himself on the\nheights of the Disruption Principles.  What these are (and in spite of\ntheir grim name they are quite innocent) no array of terms would render\nthinkable to the merely English intelligence; but to the Scot they often\nprove unctuously nourishing, and Mr. Nicholson found in them the milk of\nlions.  About the period when the churches convene at Edinburgh in their\nannual assemblies, he was to be seen descending the Mound in the company\nof divers red-headed clergymen: these voluble, he only contributing\noracular nods, brief negatives, and the austere spectacle of his\nstretched upper lip.  The names of Candlish and Begg were frequent in\nthese interviews, and occasionally the talk ran on the Residuary\nEstablishment and the doings of one Lee.  A stranger to the tight little\ntheological kingdom of Scotland might have listened and gathered\nliterally nothing.  And Mr. Nicholson (who was not a dull man) knew this,\nand raged at it.  He knew there was a vast world outside, to whom\nDisruption Principles were as the chatter of tree-top apes; the paper\nbrought him chill whiffs from it; he had met Englishmen who had asked\nlightly if he did not belong to the Church of Scotland, and then had\nfailed to be much interested by his elucidation of that nice point; it\nwas an evil, wild, rebellious world, lying sunk in _dozenedness_, for\nnothing short of a Scots word will paint this Scotsman\u2019s feelings.  And\nwhen he entered into his own house in Randolph Crescent (south side), and\nshut the door behind him, his heart swelled with security.  Here, at\nleast, was a citadel impregnable by right-hand defections or left-hand\nextremes.  Here was a family where prayers came at the same hour, where\nthe Sabbath literature was unimpeachably selected, where the guest who\nshould have leaned to any false opinion was instantly set down, and over\nwhich there reigned all week, and grew denser on Sundays, a silence that\nwas agreeable to his ear, and a gloom that he found comfortable."}

The number of inhabitants and the\nimportance of Keighley have been very greatly increased during the last\ntwenty years, owing to the rapidly extended market for worsted\nmanufactures, a branch of industry that mainly employs the factory\npopulation of this part of Yorkshire, which has Bradford for its centre\nand metropolis.\n\nKeighley is in process of transformation from a populous, old-fashioned\nvillage, into a still more populous and flourishing town.  It is evident\nto the stranger, that as the gable-ended houses, which obtrude themselves\ncorner-wise on the widening street, fall vacant, they are pulled down to\nallow of greater space for traffic, and a more modern style of\narchitecture.  The quaint and narrow shop-windows of fifty years ago, are\ngiving way to large panes and plate-glass.  Nearly every dwelling seems\ndevoted to some branch of commerce.  In passing hastily through the town,\none hardly perceives where the necessary lawyer and doctor can live, so\nlittle appearance is there of any dwellings of the professional middle-\nclass, such as abound in our old cathedral towns.  In fact, nothing can\nbe more opposed than the state of society, the modes of thinking, the\nstandards of reference on all points of morality, manners, and even\npolitics and religion, in such a new manufacturing place as Keighley in\nthe north, and any stately, sleepy, picturesque cathedral town in the\nsouth.  Yet the aspect of Keighley promises well for future stateliness,\nif not picturesqueness.  Grey stone abounds; and the rows of houses built\nof it have a kind of solid grandeur connected with their uniform and\nenduring lines.  The frame-work of the doors, and the lintels of the\nwindows, even in the smallest dwellings, are made of blocks of stone.\nThere is no painted wood to require continual beautifying, or else\npresent a shabby aspect; and the stone is kept scrupulously clean by the\nnotable Yorkshire housewives.  Such glimpses into the interior as a\npasser-by obtains, reveal a rough abundance of the means of living, and\ndiligent and active habits in the women.  But the voices of the people\nare hard, and their tones discordant, promising little of the musical\ntaste that distinguishes the district, and which has already furnished a\nCarrodus to the musical world.  The names over the shops (of which the\none just given is a sample) seem strange even to an inhabitant of the\nneighbouring county, and have a peculiar smack and flavour of the place.\n\nThe town of Keighley never quite melts into country on the road to\nHaworth, although the houses become more sparse as the traveller journeys\nupwards to the grey round hills that seem to bound his journey in a\nwesterly direction.  First come some villas; just sufficiently retired\nfrom the road to show that they can scarcely belong to any one liable to\nbe summoned in a hurry, at the call of suffering or danger, from his\ncomfortable fireside; the lawyer, the doctor, and the clergyman, live at\nhand, and hardly in the suburbs, with a screen of shrubs for concealment."}

Four times at least it occurs as a\nplace-name. There is a parish of Stevenston in Cunningham; a second\nplace of the name in the Barony of Bothwell in Lanark; a third on Lyne,\nabove Drochil Castle; the fourth on the Tyne, near Traprain Law.\nStevenson of Stevenson (co. Lanark) swore fealty to Edward I. in 1296,\nand the last of that family died after the Restoration. Stevensons of\nHirdmanshiels, in Midlothian, rode in the Bishops' Raid of Aberlady,\nserved as jurors, stood bail for neighbours--Hunter of Polwood, for\ninstance--and became extinct about the same period, or possibly earlier.\nA Stevenson of Luthrie and another of Pitroddie make their bows, give\ntheir names, and vanish. And by the year 1700 it does not appear that\nany acre of Scots land was vested in any Stevenson.[1]"}

Still, there is information in the volume;\ninformation concerning an interesting episode in the history of the Far\nWest, about which no books have been written by persons who were on the\nground in person, and saw the happenings of the time with their own\neyes. I allude to the rise, growth and culmination of the silver-mining\nfever in Nevada\u2014a curious episode, in some respects; the only one, of\nits peculiar kind, that has occurred in the land; and the only one,\nindeed, that is likely to occur in it.\n\nYes, take it all around, there is quite a good deal of information in\nthe book. I regret this very much; but really it could not be helped:\ninformation appears to stew out of me naturally, like the precious ottar\nof roses out of the otter. Sometimes it has seemed to me that I would\ngive worlds if I could retain my facts; but it cannot be. The more I\ncalk up the sources, and the tighter I get, the more I leak wisdom.\nTherefore, I can only claim indulgence at the hands of the reader, not\njustification.\n\nTHE AUTHOR.\n\nCONTENTS.\n\nCHAPTER I.

Subienkow had travelled a long trail of bitterness and\nhorror, homing like a dove for the capitals of Europe, and here, farther\naway than ever, in Russian America, the trail ceased.  He sat in the\nsnow, arms tied behind him, waiting the torture.  He stared curiously\nbefore him at a huge Cossack, prone in the snow, moaning in his pain.\nThe men had finished handling the giant and turned him over to the women.\nThat they exceeded the fiendishness of the men, the man\u2019s cries attested.\n\nSubienkow looked on, and shuddered.  He was not afraid to die.  He had\ncarried his life too long in his hands, on that weary trail from Warsaw\nto Nulato, to shudder at mere dying.  But he objected to the torture.  It\noffended his soul.  And this offence, in turn, was not due to the mere\npain he must endure, but to the sorry spectacle the pain would make of\nhim.  He knew that he would pray, and beg, and entreat, even as Big Ivan\nand the others that had gone before.  This would not be nice.  To pass\nout bravely and cleanly, with a smile and a jest\u2014ah! that would have been\nthe way.  But to lose control, to have his soul upset by the pangs of the\nflesh, to screech and gibber like an ape, to become the veriest beast\u2014ah,\nthat was what was so terrible.\n\nThere had been no chance to escape.  From the beginning, when he dreamed\nthe fiery dream of Poland\u2019s independence, he had become a puppet in the\nhands of Fate.  From the beginning, at Warsaw, at St. Petersburg, in the\nSiberian mines, in Kamtchatka, on the crazy boats of the fur-thieves,\nFate had been driving him to this end.  Without doubt, in the foundations\nof the world was graved this end for him\u2014for him, who was so fine and\nsensitive, whose nerves scarcely sheltered under his skin, who was a\ndreamer, and a poet, and an artist.  Before he was dreamed of, it had\nbeen determined that the quivering bundle of sensitiveness that\nconstituted him should be doomed to live in raw and howling savagery, and\nto die in this far land of night, in this dark place beyond the last\nboundaries of the world.\n\nHe sighed.  So that thing before him was Big Ivan\u2014Big Ivan the giant, the\nman without nerves, the man of iron, the Cossack turned freebooter of the\nseas, who was as phlegmatic as an ox, with a nervous system so low that\nwhat was pain to ordinary men was scarcely a tickle to him.  Well, well,\ntrust these Nulato Indians to find Big Ivan\u2019s nerves and trace them to\nthe roots of his quivering soul.  They were certainly doing it.  It was\ninconceivable that a man could suffer so much and yet live.  Big Ivan was\npaying for his low order of nerves.  Already he had lasted twice as long\nas any of the others."}

Fenimore Cooper\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAs this work professes, in its title-page, to be a descriptive tale,\nthey who will take the trouble to read it may be glad to know how much\nof its contents is literal fact, and how much is intended to represent\na general picture. The author is very sensible that, had he confined\nhimself to the latter, always the most effective, as it is the most\nvaluable, mode of conveying knowledge of this nature, he would have made\na far better book. But in commencing to describe scenes, and perhaps he\nmay add characters, that were so familiar to his own youth, there was\na constant temptation to delineate that which he had known, rather than\nthat which he might have imagined. This rigid adhesion to truth, an\nindispensable requisite in history and travels, destroys the charm of\nfiction; for all that is necessary to be conveyed to the mind by\nthe latter had better be done by delineations of principles, and of\ncharacters in their classes, than by a too fastidious attention to\noriginals.\n\nNew York having but one county of Otsego, and the Susquehanna but one\nproper source, there can be no mistake as to the site of the tale. The\nhistory of this district of country, so far as it is connected with\ncivilized men, is soon told.\n\nOtsego, in common with most of the interior of the province of New\nYork, was included in the county of Albany previously to the war of the\nseparation. It then became, in a subsequent division of territory, a\npart of Montgomery; and finally, having obtained a sufficient population\nof its own, it was set apart as a county by itself shortly after the\npeace of 1783. It lies among those low spurs of the Alleghanies which\ncover the midland counties of New York, and it is a little east of a\nmeridional line drawn through the centre of the State. As the waters\nof New York flow either southerly into the Atlantic or northerly\ninto Ontario and its outlet, Otsego Lake, being the source of the\nSusquehanna, is of necessity among its highest lands. The face of the\ncountry, the climate as it was found by the whites, and the manners of\nthe settlers, are described with a minuteness for which the author has\nno other apology than the force of his own recollections.\n\nOtsego is said to be a word compounded of Ot, a place of meeting, and\nSego, or Sago, the ordinary term of salutation used by the Indians of\nthis region. There is a tradition which says that the neighboring tribes\nwere accustomed to meet on the banks of the lake to make their treaties,\nand otherwise to strengthen their alliances, and which refers the name\nto this practice. As the Indian agent of New York had a log dwelling at\nthe foot of the lake, however, it is not impossible that the appellation\ngrew out of the meetings that were held at his council fires; the war\ndrove off the agent, in common with the other officers of the crown;\nand his rude dwelling was soon abandoned. The author remembers it, a few\nyears later, reduced to the humble office of a smoke-house."}

Allow me, by inscribing the\ncollection to you, to secure one reader for it at the outset of its\nprogress through the world of letters whose capacity for seeing all a\nwriter\u2019s defects may be matched by many other critics, but whose rarer\nfaculty of seeing all a writer\u2019s merits is equaled by very few."}

The springlike transparent sky\nshed a rain of silver sunshine on the roofs of the village, and on the\npastures and larchwoods surrounding it. A little wind moved among the\nround white clouds on the shoulders of the hills, driving their shadows\nacross the fields and down the grassy road that takes the name of street\nwhen it passes through North Dormer. The place lies high and in the\nopen, and lacks the lavish shade of the more protected New England\nvillages. The clump of weeping-willows about the duck pond, and the\nNorway spruces in front of the Hatchard gate, cast almost the only\nroadside shadow between lawyer Royall's house and the point where, at\nthe other end of the village, the road rises above the church and skirts\nthe black hemlock wall enclosing the cemetery.\n\nThe little June wind, frisking down the street, shook the doleful\nfringes of the Hatchard spruces, caught the straw hat of a young man\njust passing under them, and spun it clean across the road into the\nduck-pond.\n\nAs he ran to fish it out the girl on lawyer Royall's doorstep noticed\nthat he was a stranger, that he wore city clothes, and that he was\nlaughing with all his teeth, as the young and careless laugh at such\nmishaps.\n\nHer heart contracted a little, and the shrinking that sometimes came\nover her when she saw people with holiday faces made her draw back into\nthe house and pretend to look for the key that she knew she had already\nput into her pocket. A narrow greenish mirror with a gilt eagle over it\nhung on the passage wall, and she looked critically at her reflection,\nwished for the thousandth time that she had blue eyes like Annabel\nBalch, the girl who sometimes came from Springfield to spend a week with\nold Miss Hatchard, straightened the sunburnt hat over her small swarthy\nface, and turned out again into the sunshine.\n\n\u201cHow I hate everything!\u201d she murmured.\n\nThe young man had passed through the Hatchard gate, and she had the\nstreet to herself. North Dormer is at all times an empty place, and at\nthree o'clock on a June afternoon its few able-bodied men are off in\nthe fields or woods, and the women indoors, engaged in languid household\ndrudgery.\n\nThe girl walked along, swinging her key on a finger, and looking about\nher with the heightened attention produced by the presence of a stranger\nin a familiar place. What, she wondered, did North Dormer look like to\npeople from other parts of the world? She herself had lived there\nsince the age of five, and had long supposed it to be a place of some\nimportance. But about a year before, Mr. Miles, the new Episcopal\nclergyman at Hepburn, who drove over every other Sunday--when the roads\nwere not ploughed up by hauling--to hold a service in the North Dormer\nchurch, had proposed, in a fit of missionary zeal, to take the young\npeople down to Nettleton to hear an illustrated lecture on the Holy\nLand; and the dozen girls and boys who represented the future of North\nDormer had been piled into a farm-waggon, driven over the hills to\nHepburn, put into a way-train and carried to Nettleton."}

AMEN\n\nDEDICATION\n\nMy dear Jebb,\n\nStrange as were the adventures and escapes of Thomas Wingfield, once of\nthis parish, whereof these pages tell, your own can almost equal them\nin these latter days, and, since a fellow feeling makes us kind, you at\nleast they may move to a sigh of sympathy. Among many a distant land\nyou know that in which he loved and fought, following vengeance and his\nfate, and by your side I saw its relics and its peoples, its volcans\nand its valleys. You know even where lies the treasure which, three\ncenturies and more ago, he helped to bury, the countless treasure that\nan evil fortune held us back from seeking. Now the Indians have taken\nback their secret, and though many may search, none will lift the\ngraven stone that seals it, nor shall the light of day shine again upon\nthe golden head of Montezuma. So be it! The wealth which Cortes wept\nover, and his Spaniards sinned and died for, is for ever hidden yonder\nby the shores of the bitter lake whose waters gave up to you that\nancient horror, the veritable and sleepless god of Sacrifice, of whom I\nwould not rob you\u2014and, for my part, I do not regret the loss.\n\nWhat cannot be lost, what to me seem of more worth than the dead hero\nGuatemoc\u2019s gems and jars of gold, are the memories of true friendship\nshown to us far away beneath the shadow of the Slumbering Woman,[1] and\nit is in gratitude for these that I ask permission to set your name\nwithin a book which were it not for you would never have been written.\n\nI am, my dear Jebb,\nAlways sincerely yours,\nH. RIDER HAGGARD."}

G. WELLS\n\n[Illustration: He stopped, and then made a dash to escape from their\nclosing ranks.]\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe enterprise of Messrs. T. Nelson & Sons and the friendly accommodation\nof Messrs. Macmillan render possible this collection in one cover of all\nthe short stories by me that I care for any one to read again. Except for\nthe two series of linked incidents that make up the bulk of the book\ncalled _Tales of Space and Time_, no short story of mine of the\nslightest merit is excluded from this volume. Many of very questionable\nmerit find a place; it is an inclusive and not an exclusive gathering.\nAnd the task of selection and revision brings home to me with something of\nthe effect of discovery that I was once an industrious writer of short\nstories, and that I am no longer anything of the kind. I have not written\none now for quite a long time, and in the past five or six years I have\nmade scarcely one a year. The bulk of the fifty or sixty tales from which\nthis present three-and-thirty have been chosen dates from the last\ncentury. This edition is more definitive than I supposed when first I\narranged for it. In the presence of so conclusive an ebb and cessation an\nalmost obituary manner seems justifiable.\n\nI find it a little difficult to disentangle the causes that have\nrestricted the flow of these inventions. It has happened, I remark, to\nothers as well as to myself, and in spite of the kindliest encouragement\nto continue from editors and readers. There was a time when life bubbled\nwith short stories; they were always coming to the surface of my mind, and\nit is no deliberate change of will that has thus restricted my production.\nIt is rather, I think, a diversion of attention to more sustained and more\nexacting forms. It was my friend Mr. C.L. Hind who set that spring going.\nHe urged me to write short stories for the _Pall Mall Budget_, and\npersuaded me by his simple and buoyant conviction that I could do what he\ndesired. There existed at the time only the little sketch, \"The Jilting of\nJane,\" included in this volume--at least, that is the only tolerable\nfragment of fiction I find surviving from my pre-Lewis-Hind period. But I\nset myself, so encouraged, to the experiment of inventing moving and\ninteresting things that could be given vividly in the little space of\neight or ten such pages as this, and for a time I found it a very\nentertaining pursuit indeed. Mr. Hind's indicating finger had shown me an\namusing possibility of the mind. I found that, taking almost anything as a\nstarting-point and letting my thoughts play about it, there would\npresently come out of the darkness, in a manner quite inexplicable, some\nabsurd or vivid little incident more or less relevant to that initial\nnucleus. Little men in canoes upon sunlit oceans would come floating out\nof nothingness, incubating the eggs of prehistoric monsters unawares;\nviolent conflicts would break out amidst the flower-beds of suburban\ngardens; I would discover I was peering into remote and mysterious worlds\nruled by an order logical indeed but other than our common sanity."}

He wore rough clothes that\nsmacked of the sea, and he was manifestly out of place in the spacious\nhall in which he found himself. He did not know what to do with his\ncap, and was stuffing it into his coat pocket when the other took it\nfrom him. The act was done quietly and naturally, and the awkward young\nfellow appreciated it. \u201cHe understands,\u201d was his thought. \u201cHe\u2019ll see me\nthrough all right.\u201d\n\nHe walked at the other\u2019s heels with a swing to his shoulders, and his\nlegs spread unwittingly, as if the level floors were tilting up and\nsinking down to the heave and lunge of the sea. The wide rooms seemed\ntoo narrow for his rolling gait, and to himself he was in terror lest\nhis broad shoulders should collide with the doorways or sweep the\nbric-a-brac from the low mantel. He recoiled from side to side between\nthe various objects and multiplied the hazards that in reality lodged\nonly in his mind. Between a grand piano and a centre-table piled high\nwith books was space for a half a dozen to walk abreast, yet he essayed\nit with trepidation. His heavy arms hung loosely at his sides. He did\nnot know what to do with those arms and hands, and when, to his excited\nvision, one arm seemed liable to brush against the books on the table,\nhe lurched away like a frightened horse, barely missing the piano\nstool. He watched the easy walk of the other in front of him, and for\nthe first time realized that his walk was different from that of other\nmen. He experienced a momentary pang of shame that he should walk so\nuncouthly. The sweat burst through the skin of his forehead in tiny\nbeads, and he paused and mopped his bronzed face with his handkerchief.\n\n\u201cHold on, Arthur, my boy,\u201d he said, attempting to mask his anxiety with\nfacetious utterance. \u201cThis is too much all at once for yours truly.\nGive me a chance to get my nerve.

Published November, 1910\n\nPREFACE\n\nThe subject of imposture is always an interesting one, and impostors\nin one shape or another are likely to flourish as long as human nature\nremains what it is, and society shows itself ready to be gulled.\nThe histories of famous cases of imposture in this book have been\ngrouped together to show that the art has been practised in many\nforms--impersonators, pretenders, swindlers, and humbugs of all kinds;\nthose who have masqueraded in order to acquire wealth, position, or\nfame, and those who have done so merely for the love of the art.\nSo numerous are instances, indeed, that the book cannot profess to\nexhaust a theme which might easily fill a dozen volumes; its purpose is\nsimply to collect and record a number of the best known instances. The\nauthor, nevertheless, whose largest experience has lain in the field of\nfiction, has aimed at dealing with his material as with the material\nfor a novel, except that all the facts given are real and authentic. He\nhas made no attempt to treat the subject ethically; yet from a study of\nthese impostors, the objects they had in view, the means they adopted,\nthe risks they ran, and the punishments which attended exposure, any\nreader can draw his own conclusions.\n\nImpostors of royalty are placed first on account of the fascinating\nglamour of the throne which has allured so many to the attempt. Perkin\nWarbeck began a life of royal imposture at the age of seventeen and\nyet got an army round him and dared to make war on Harry Hotspur\nbefore ending his short and stormy life on the gallows. With a crown\nfor stake, it is not surprising that men have been found willing to\nrun even such risks as those taken by the impostors of Sebastian\nof Portugal and Louis XVII of France. That imposture, even if\nunsuccessful, may be very difficult to detect, is shown in the cases of\nPrincess Olive and Cagliostro, and in those of Hannah Snell, Mary East,\nand the many women who in military and naval, as well as in civil, life\nassumed and maintained even in the din of battle the simulation of men.\n\nOne of the most extraordinary and notorious impostures ever known was\nthat of Arthur Orton, the Tichborne Claimant, whose ultimate exposure\nnecessitated the employment, at great public expense of time and\nmoney, of the best judicial and forensic wits in a legal process of\nunprecedented length.\n\nThe belief in witches, though not extinct in our country even to-day,\naffords examples of the converse of imposture, for in the majority of\ncases it was the superstitions of society which attributed powers of\nevil to innocent persons whose subsequent mock-trials and butchery\nmade a public holiday for their so-called judges."}

Her\ntranslation of Spinoza\u2019s \u201cEthics\u201d was finished the same year, but remains\nunpublished.  She was associate editor of _The Westminster Review_ from\n1851 to 1853.  She was about twenty-seven years of age when her first\ntranslation appeared, thirty-three when the first of these magazine\narticles appeared, thirty-eight at the publication of her first story,\nand fifty-nine when she finished \u201cTheophrastus Such.\u201d  Two years after\nshe died, at the age of sixty-one.  So that George Eliot\u2019s literary life\ncovered a period of about thirty-two years."}

It is the first short story I ever wrote and\nmarks, in a manner of speaking, the end of my first phase, the Malayan\nphase with its special subject and its verbal suggestions. Conceived in\nthe same mood which produced \u0093Almayer\u0092s Folly\u0094 and \u0093An Outcast of the\nIslands,\u0094 it is told in the same breath (with what was left of it, that\nis, after the end of \u0093An Outcast\u0094), seen with the same vision, rendered\nin the same method--if such a thing as method did exist then in my\nconscious relation to this new adventure of writing for print. I\ndoubt it very much. One does one\u0092s work first and theorises about it\nafterwards. It is a very amusing and egotistical occupation of no\nuse whatever to any one and just as likely as not to lead to false\nconclusions.\n\nAnybody can see that between the last paragraph of \u0093An Outcast\u0094 and\nthe first of \u0093The Lagoon\u0094 there has been no change of pen, figuratively\nspeaking. It happened also to be literally true. It was the same pen: a\ncommon steel pen. Having been charged with a certain lack of emotional\nfaculty I am glad to be able to say that on one occasion at least I did\ngive way to a sentimental impulse. I thought the pen had been a good pen\nand that it had done enough for me, and so, with the idea of keeping it\nfor a sort of memento on which I could look later with tender eyes, I\nput it into my waistcoat pocket. Afterwards it used to turn up in all\nsorts of places--at the bottom of small drawers, among my studs in\ncardboard boxes--till at last it found permanent rest in a large wooden\nbowl containing some loose keys, bits of sealing wax, bits of string,\nsmall broken chains, a few buttons, and similar minute wreckage that\nwashes out of a man\u0092s life into such receptacles. I would catch sight of\nit from time to time with a distinct feeling of satisfaction till, one\nday, I perceived with horror that there were two old pens in there. How\nthe other pen found its way into the bowl instead of the fireplace or\nwastepaper basket I can\u0092t imagine, but there the two were, lying side by\nside, both encrusted with ink and completely undistinguishable from each\nother. It was very distressing, but being determined not to share my\nsentiment between two pens or run the risk of sentimentalising over\na mere stranger, I threw them both out of the window into a flower\nbed--which strikes me now as a poetical grave for the remnants of one\u0092s\npast."}

To the west the\nground was broken and rough, and a narrow strip of timber wound along\nthe turbid, muddy little stream that had scarcely ambition enough to\ncrawl over its black bottom. If it had not been for the few stunted\ncottonwoods and elms that grew along its banks, Canute would have shot\nhimself years ago. The Norwegians are a timber-loving people, and if\nthere is even a turtle pond with a few plum bushes around it they seem\nirresistibly drawn toward it.\n\nAs to the shanty itself, Canute had built it without aid of any kind,\nfor when he first squatted along the banks of Rattlesnake Creek there\nwas not a human being within twenty miles. It was built of logs split\nin halves, the chinks stopped with mud and plaster. The roof was covered\nwith earth and was supported by one gigantic beam curved in the shape of\na round arch. It was almost impossible that any tree had ever grown in\nthat shape. The Norwegians used to say that Canute had taken the log\nacross his knee and bent it into the shape he wished. There were\ntwo rooms, or rather there was one room with a partition made of ash\nsaplings interwoven and bound together like big straw basket work. In\none corner there was a cook stove, rusted and broken. In the other a\nbed made of unplaned planks and poles. It was fully eight feet long, and\nupon it was a heap of dark bed clothing. There was a chair and a bench\nof colossal proportions. There was an ordinary kitchen cupboard with\na few cracked dirty dishes in it, and beside it on a tall box a tin\nwashbasin. Under the bed was a pile of pint flasks, some broken,\nsome whole, all empty. On the wood box lay a pair of shoes of almost\nincredible dimensions. On the wall hung a saddle, a gun, and some ragged\nclothing, conspicuous among which was a suit of dark cloth, apparently\nnew, with a paper collar carefully wrapped in a red silk handkerchief\nand pinned to the sleeve. Over the door hung a wolf and a badger skin,\nand on the door itself a brace of thirty or forty snake skins whose\nnoisy tails rattled ominously every time it opened. The strangest things\nin the shanty were the wide windowsills. At first glance they looked as\nthough they had been ruthlessly hacked and mutilated with a hatchet, but\non closer inspection all the notches and holes in the wood took form and\nshape. There seemed to be a series of pictures. They were, in a rough\nway, artistic, but the figures were heavy and labored, as though they\nhad been cut very slowly and with very awkward instruments. There were\nmen plowing with little horned imps sitting on their shoulders and on\ntheir horses' heads. There were men praying with a skull hanging over\ntheir heads and little demons behind them mocking their attitudes. There\nwere men fighting with big serpents, and skeletons dancing together. All\nabout these pictures were blooming vines and foliage such as never grew\nin this world, and coiled among the branches of the vines there was\nalways the scaly body of a serpent, and behind every flower there was\na serpent's head. It was a veritable Dance of Death by one who had felt\nits sting. In the wood box lay some boards, and every inch of them\nwas cut up in the same manner. Sometimes the work was very rude and\ncareless, and looked as though the hand of the workman had trembled. It\nwould sometimes have been hard to distinguish the men from their evil\ngeniuses but for one fact, the men were always grave and were either\ntoiling or praying, while the devils were always smiling and dancing.\nSeveral of these boards had been split for kindling and it was evident\nthat the artist did not value his work highly."}

Cushing Co.--Berwick & Smith Co.\n\nNorwood, Mass., U.S.A.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\u201c_A philosophy of the history of the human race, worthy of its name,\nmust begin with the heavens and descend to the earth, must be charged\nwith the conviction that all existence is one--a single conception\nsustained from beginning to end upon one identical law._\u201d--FRIEDRICH\nRATZEL.\n\nThis _Outline of History_ is an attempt to tell, truly and clearly, in\none continuous narrative, the whole story of life and mankind so far as\nit is known to-day. It is written plainly for the general reader, but\nits aim goes beyond its use as merely interesting reading matter. There\nis a feeling abroad that the teaching of history considered as a part of\ngeneral education is in an unsatisfactory condition, and particularly\nthat the ordinary treatment of this \u201csubject\u201d by the class and teacher\nand examiner is too partial and narrow. But the desire to extend the\ngeneral range of historical ideas is confronted by the argument that the\navailable time for instruction is already consumed by that partial and\nnarrow treatment, and that therefore, however desirable this extension\nof range may be, it is in practice impossible. If an Englishman, for\nexample, has found the history of England quite enough for his powers of\nassimilation, then it seems hopeless to expect his sons and daughters to\nmaster universal history, if that is to consist of the history of\nEngland, plus the history of France, plus the history of Germany, plus\nthe history of Russia, and so on. To which the only possible answer is\nthat universal history is at once something more and something less than\nthe aggregate of the national histories to which we are accustomed, that\nit must be approached in a different spirit and dealt with in a\ndifferent manner. This book seeks to justify that answer. It has been\nwritten primarily to show that _history as one whole_ is amenable to a\nmore broad and comprehensive handling than is the history of special\nnations and periods, a broader handling that will bring it within the\nnormal limitations of time and energy set to the reading and education\nof an ordinary citizen. This outline deals with ages and races and\nnations, where the ordinary history deals with reigns and pedigrees and\ncampaigns; but it will not be found to be more crowded with names and\ndates, nor more difficult to follow and understand. History is no\nexception amongst the sciences; as the gaps fill in, the outline\nsimplifies; as the outlook broadens, the clustering multitude of details\ndissolves into general laws. And many topics of quite primary interest\nto mankind, the first appearance and the growth of scientific knowledge\nfor example, and its effects upon human life, the elaboration of the\nideas of money and credit, or the story of the origins and spread and\ninfluence of Christianity, which must be treated fragmentarily or by\nelaborate digressions in any partial history, arise and flow completely\nand naturally in one general record of the world in which we live."}

It was a matter of\nunusual interest to them that a plantation of four thousand acres had\nbeen left unincumbered to the disposal of a handsome, inconsolable,\nchildless Creole widow of thirty. A _b\u00eatise_ of some sort might safely\nbe looked for. But time passing, the anticipated folly failed to\nreveal itself; and the only wonder was that Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Lafirme so\nsuccessfully followed the methods of her departed husband.\n\nOf course Th\u00e9r\u00e8se had wanted to die with her J\u00e9r\u00f4me, feeling that life\nwithout him held nothing that could reconcile her to its further\nendurance. For days she lived alone with her grief; shutting out the\nappeals that came to her from the demoralized \u201chands,\u201d and unmindful\nof the disorder that gathered about her. Till Uncle Hiram came one day\nwith a respectful tender of sympathy, offered in the guise of a\nreckless misquoting of Scripture--and with a grievance.\n\n\u201cMistuss,\u201d he said, \u201cI \u2019lowed \u2019twar best to come to de house an\u2019 tell\nyou; fur Massa he alluz did say \u2018Hi\u2019urm, I counts on you to keep a eye\nopen endurin\u2019 my appersunce;\u2019 you ricollic, marm?\u201d addressing an\nexpanse of black bordered cambric that veiled the features of his\nmistress. \u201cThings is a goin\u2019 wrong; dat dey is. I don\u2019t wants to name\nno names \u2019doubt I\u2019se \u2019bleeged to; but dey done start a kiarrin\u2019 de\ncotton seed off de place, and dats how.\u201d\n\nIf Hiram\u2019s information had confined itself to the bare statement of\nthings \u201cgoin\u2019 wrong,\u201d such intimation, of its nature vague and\nsusceptible of uncertain interpretation, might have failed to rouse\nTh\u00e9r\u00e8se from her lethargy of grief. But that wrong doing presented as\na tangible abuse and defiance of authority, served to move her to\naction. She felt at once the weight and sacredness of a trust, whose\nacceptance brought consolation and awakened unsuspected powers of\ndoing.\n\nIn spite of Uncle Hiram\u2019s parting prediction \u201cde cotton \u2019ll be a goin\u2019\nnaxt\u201d no more seed was hauled under cover of darkness from\nPlace-du-Bois."}

I had come\nto believe it infallible in its judgments about the time of day, and to\nconsider its constitution and its anatomy imperishable.  But at last, one\nnight, I let it run down.  I grieved about it as if it were a recognized\nmessenger and forerunner of calamity.  But by and by I cheered up, set\nthe watch by guess, and commanded my bodings and superstitions to depart.\nNext day I stepped into the chief jeweler's to set it by the exact time,\nand the head of the establishment took it out of my hand and proceeded to\nset it for me.  Then he said, \u201cShe is four minutes slow-regulator wants\npushing up.\u201d  I tried to stop him--tried to make him understand that the\nwatch kept perfect time.  But no; all this human cabbage could see was\nthat the watch was four minutes slow, and the regulator must be pushed up\na little; and so, while I danced around him in anguish, and implored him\nto let the watch alone, he calmly and cruelly did the shameful deed.  My\nwatch began to gain.  It gained faster and faster day by day.  Within the\nweek it sickened to a raging fever, and its pulse went up to a hundred\nand fifty in the shade.  At the end of two months it had left all the\ntimepieces of the town far in the rear, and was a fraction over thirteen\ndays ahead of the almanac.  It was away into November enjoying the snow,\nwhile the October leaves were still turning.  It hurried up house rent,\nbills payable, and such things, in such a ruinous way that I could not\nabide it.  I took it to the watchmaker to be regulated.  He asked me if I\nhad ever had it repaired.  I said no, it had never needed any repairing.\nHe looked a look of vicious happiness and eagerly pried the watch open,\nand then put a small dice-box into his eye and peered into its machinery.\nHe said it wanted cleaning and oiling, besides regulating--come in a\nweek.  After being cleaned and oiled, and regulated, my watch slowed down\nto that degree that it ticked like a tolling bell.  I began to be left by\ntrains, I failed all appointments, I got to missing my dinner; my watch\nstrung out three days' grace to four and let me go to protest;\nI gradually drifted back into yesterday, then day before, then into last\nweek, and by and by the comprehension came upon me that all solitary and\nalone I was lingering along in week before last, and the world was out of\nsight.  I seemed to detect in myself a sort of sneaking fellow-feeling\nfor the mummy in the museum, and a desire to swap news with him.  I went\nto a watchmaker again.  He took the watch all to pieces while I waited,\nand then said the barrel was \u201cswelled.\u201d  He said he could reduce it in\nthree days.  After this the watch averaged well, but nothing more.  For\nhalf a day it would go like the very mischief, and keep up such a barking\nand wheezing and whooping and sneezing and snorting, that I could not\nhear myself think for the disturbance; and as long as it held out there\nwas not a watch in the land that stood any chance against it.  But the\nrest of the day it would keep on slowing down and fooling along until all\nthe clocks it had left behind caught up again.  So at last, at the end of\ntwenty-four hours, it would trot up to the judges' stand all right and\njust in time.  It would show a fair and square average, and no man could\nsay it had done more or less than its duty.  But a correct average is\nonly a mild virtue in a watch, and I took this instrument to another\nwatchmaker.  He said the king-bolt was broken.  I said I was glad it was\nnothing more serious.  To tell the plain truth, I had no idea what the\nking-bolt was, but I did not choose to appear ignorant to a stranger.\nHe repaired the king-bolt, but what the watch gained in one way it lost\nin another.  It would run awhile and then stop awhile, and then run\nawhile again, and so on, using its own discretion about the intervals.\nAnd every time it went off it kicked back like a musket.  I padded my\nbreast for a few days, but finally took the watch to another watchmaker.\nHe picked it all to pieces, and turned the ruin over and over under his\nglass; and then he said there appeared to be something the matter with\nthe hair-trigger.  He fixed it, and gave it a fresh start.  It did well\nnow, except that always at ten minutes to ten the hands would shut\ntogether like a pair of scissors, and from that time forth they would\ntravel together.  The oldest man in the world could not make head or tail\nof the time of day by such a watch, and so I went again to have the thing\nrepaired.  This person said that the crystal had got bent, and that the\nmainspring was not straight.  He also remarked that part of the works\nneeded half-soling.  He made these things all right, and then my\ntimepiece performed unexceptionably, save that now and then, after\nworking along quietly for nearly eight hours, everything inside would let\ngo all of a sudden and begin to buzz like a bee, and the hands would\nstraightway begin to spin round and round so fast that their\nindividuality was lost completely, and they simply seemed a delicate\nspider's web over the face of the watch.  She would reel off the next\ntwenty-four hours in six or seven minutes, and then stop with a bang.\nI went with a heavy heart to one more watchmaker, and looked on while he\ntook her to pieces.  Then I prepared to cross-question him rigidly, for\nthis thing was getting serious.  The watch had cost two hundred dollars\noriginally, and I seemed to have paid out two or three thousand for\nrepairs.  While I waited and looked on I presently recognized in this\nwatchmaker an old acquaintance--a steamboat engineer of other days, and\nnot a good engineer, either.  He examined all the parts carefully, just\nas the other watchmakers had done, and then delivered his verdict with\nthe same confidence of manner."}

A very paradise of painters. The circle of the stars\ncut by the circle of the mountains. At least, so looks it from the\nhouse; though, once upon the mountains, no circle of them can you see.\nHad the site been chosen five rods off, this charmed ring would not\nhave been.\n\nThe house is old. Seventy years since, from the heart of the Hearth\nStone Hills, they quarried the Kaaba, or Holy Stone, to which, each\nThanksgiving, the social pilgrims used to come. So long ago, that, in\ndigging for the foundation, the workmen used both spade and axe,\nfighting the Troglodytes of those subterranean parts\u2014sturdy roots of a\nsturdy wood, encamped upon what is now a long land-slide of sleeping\nmeadow, sloping away off from my poppy-bed. Of that knit wood, but one\nsurvivor stands\u2014an elm, lonely through steadfastness.\n\nWhoever built the house, he builded better than he knew; or else Orion\nin the zenith flashed down his Damocles\u2019 sword to him some starry\nnight, and said, \u201cBuild there.\u201d For how, otherwise, could it have\nentered the builder\u2019s mind, that, upon the clearing being made, such a\npurple prospect would be his?\u2014nothing less than Greylock, with all his\nhills about him, like Charlemagne among his peers.\n\nNow, for a house, so situated in such a country, to have no piazza for\nthe convenience of those who might desire to feast upon the view, and\ntake their time and ease about it, seemed as much of an omission as if\na picture-gallery should have no bench; for what but picture-galleries\nare the marble halls of these same limestone hills?\u2014galleries hung,\nmonth after month anew, with pictures ever fading into pictures ever\nfresh. And beauty is like piety\u2014you cannot run and read it;\ntranquillity and constancy, with, now-a-days, an easy chair, are\nneeded. For though, of old, when reverence was in vogue, and indolence\nwas not, the devotees of Nature, doubtless, used to stand and\nadore\u2014just as, in the cathedrals of those ages, the worshipers of a\nhigher Power did\u2014yet, in these times of failing faith and feeble knees,\nwe have the piazza and the pew."}

Here, at least, it was quiet.\n\nThinking had always been hard work for Mamma Goose. And besides, her\nfamily kept her so busy that she had no time for it anyway. There was\nalways something to be done for the babies.\n\nFor Mamma Goose had a whole dozen of the dearest little goslings, and\nshe was very proud of them. They were soft, and round, and fluffy, like\nlittle yellow balls, and besides being prettier than any other babies in\nthe barnyard, they were so bright, too, and knew as much as any gosling\ncould be expected to know,--far more than little Red Hen's chicks, even\nthough she did make such a fuss about them!\n\nThe goslings could hunt for their breakfasts almost as well as their\nmother, while little Red Hen had to scratch up every thing her children\nate. And as for the water--well, the chicks were simply not in it there!\nThey did not like to be in the water at all, but the goslings loved\ntheir morning bath in the brook better than anything else in the whole\nday.\n\nYes, her goslings were by far the finer babies! Mamma Goose swelled with\npride when she thought of it, and carefully smoothed her feathers. She\ncould have been perfectly happy except for just one thing. She was\nafraid that before long something dreadful might happen to the goslings,\nand once more she settled herself to think.\n\nThere was something wrong in the barnyard. What could it be that came\neach night when every one was sound asleep? And what was it that carried\none of the chickens away each time so that, when the next morning came,\nthere was always one less than there had been the day before? Whatever\nit was, it made no noise. Only, always the next morning some one was\nmissing, and usually it was a little baby chick that was gone. The worst\nof it was that no one else knew any more about it than she did. To be\nsure, little Bantam Rooster had said it was the hawk. But then Bantam\nalways thought he knew everything, and was almost always wrong, so that\nnobody ever believed anything he said.\n\nBesides, if it had been, the big white cock would have known it, for the\nbig white cock knew everything. He was the king of the barnyard, and\ntook care of them all. He had a bright red comb and beautiful, long,\ngreen tail-feathers, and Mamma Goose thought him the most wonderful\nbeing in the whole world."}

On this mighty tide the black\nships\u2014laden with the fresh-scented fir-planks, with rounded sacks of\noil-bearing seed, or with the dark glitter of coal\u2014are borne along to\nthe town of St Ogg\u2019s, which shows its aged, fluted red roofs and the\nbroad gables of its wharves between the low wooded hill and the\nriver-brink, tingeing the water with a soft purple hue under the\ntransient glance of this February sun. Far away on each hand stretch\nthe rich pastures, and the patches of dark earth made ready for the\nseed of broad-leaved green crops, or touched already with the tint of\nthe tender-bladed autumn-sown corn. There is a remnant still of last\nyear\u2019s golden clusters of beehive-ricks rising at intervals beyond the\nhedgerows; and everywhere the hedgerows are studded with trees; the\ndistant ships seem to be lifting their masts and stretching their\nred-brown sails close among the branches of the spreading ash. Just by\nthe red-roofed town the tributary Ripple flows with a lively current\ninto the Floss. How lovely the little river is, with its dark changing\nwavelets! It seems to me like a living companion while I wander along\nthe bank, and listen to its low, placid voice, as to the voice of one\nwho is deaf and loving. I remember those large dipping willows. I\nremember the stone bridge."}

PREFACE TO READERS IN GENERAL\n\nYou are the children of Old Mother England, on both sides of the\nAtlantic; you form the majority of buyers and borrowers of novels; and\nyou judge of works of fiction by certain inbred preferences, which but\nslightly influence the other great public of readers on the continent of\nEurope.\n\nThe two qualities in fiction which hold the highest rank in your\nestimation are: Character and Humour. Incident and dramatic situation\nonly occupy the second place in your favour. A novel that tells no\nstory, or that blunders perpetually in trying to tell a story--a novel\nso entirely devoid of all sense of the dramatic side of human life,\nthat not even a theatrical thief can find anything in it to steal--will\nnevertheless be a work that wins (and keeps) your admiration, if it has\nHumour which dwells on your memory, and characters which enlarge the\ncircle of your friends.\n\nI have myself always tried to combine the different merits of a good\nnovel, in one and the same work; and I have never succeeded in keeping\nan equal balance. In the present story you will find the scales\ninclining, on the whole, in favour of character and Humour. This has not\nhappened accidentally.\n\nAdvancing years, and health that stands sadly in need of improvement,\nwarn me--if I am to vary my way of work--that I may have little time\nto lose. Without waiting for future opportunities, I have kept your\nstandard of merit more constantly before my mind, in writing this book,\nthan on some former occasions.\n\nStill persisting in telling you a story--still refusing to get up in the\npulpit and preach, or to invade the platform and lecture, or to take you\nby the buttonhole in confidence and make fun of my Art--it has been\nmy chief effort to draw the characters with a vigour and breadth of\ntreatment, derived from the nearest and truest view that I could get of\nthe one model, Nature. Whether I shall at once succeed in adding to\nthe circle of your friends in the world of fiction--or whether you will\nhurry through the narrative, and only discover on a later reading that\nit is the characters which have interested you in the story--remains to\nbe seen. Either way, your sympathy will find me grateful; for, either\nway, my motive has been to please you.\n\nDuring its periodical publication correspondents, noting certain\npassages in \u201cHeart and Science,\u201d inquired how I came to think of writing\nthis book. The question may be readily answered in better words than\nmine. My book has been written in harmony with opinions which have an\nindisputable claim to respect. Let them speak for themselves.\n\nSHAKESPEARE\u2019S OPINION.--\u201cIt was always yet the trick of our\nEnglish nation, if they have a good thing, to make it too common.\u201d\n _(King Henry IV., Part II.)_"}

To the historian it bristles with errors\u2014not\nerrors of fact, but errors of interpretation. Looking back across the\nseven centuries that have lapsed since Avis Everhard completed her\nmanuscript, events, and the bearings of events, that were confused and\nveiled to her, are clear to us. She lacked perspective. She was too\nclose to the events she writes about. Nay, she was merged in the events\nshe has described.\n\nNevertheless, as a personal document, the Everhard Manuscript is of\ninestimable value. But here again enter error of perspective, and\nvitiation due to the bias of love. Yet we smile, indeed, and forgive\nAvis Everhard for the heroic lines upon which she modelled her husband.\nWe know to-day that he was not so colossal, and that he loomed among\nthe events of his times less largely than the Manuscript would lead us\nto believe.\n\nWe know that Ernest Everhard was an exceptionally strong man, but not\nso exceptional as his wife thought him to be. He was, after all, but\none of a large number of heroes who, throughout the world, devoted\ntheir lives to the Revolution; though it must be conceded that he did\nunusual work, especially in his elaboration and interpretation of\nworking-class philosophy. \u201cProletarian science\u201d and \u201cproletarian\nphilosophy\u201d were his phrases for it, and therein he shows the\nprovincialism of his mind\u2014a defect, however, that was due to the times\nand that none in that day could escape.\n\nBut to return to the Manuscript. Especially valuable is it in\ncommunicating to us the _feel_ of those terrible times. Nowhere do we\nfind more vividly portrayed the psychology of the persons that lived in\nthat turbulent period embraced between the years 1912 and 1932\u2014their\nmistakes and ignorance, their doubts and fears and misapprehensions,\ntheir ethical delusions, their violent passions, their inconceivable\nsordidness and selfishness. These are the things that are so hard for\nus of this enlightened age to understand. History tells us that these\nthings were, and biology and psychology tell us why they were; but\nhistory and biology and psychology do not make these things alive. We\naccept them as facts, but we are left without sympathetic comprehension\nof them."}

Conclusion\n\nIntroduction\n\n\u201cThe deepest parts of the ocean are totally unknown to us,\u201d admits\nProfessor Aronnax early in this novel. \u201cWhat goes on in those distant\ndepths? What creatures inhabit, or could inhabit, those regions twelve\nor fifteen miles beneath the surface of the water? It\u2019s almost beyond\nconjecture.\u201d\n\nJules Verne (1828-1905) published the French equivalents of these\nwords in 1869, and little has changed since. 126 years later, a Time\ncover story on deep-sea exploration made much the same admission: \u201cWe\nknow more about Mars than we know about the oceans.\u201d This reality\nbegins to explain the dark power and otherworldly fascination of\nTwenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas.\n\nBorn in the French river town of Nantes, Verne had a lifelong passion\nfor the sea. First as a Paris stockbroker, later as a celebrated\nauthor and yachtsman, he went on frequent voyages\u2014to Britain, America,\nthe Mediterranean. But the specific stimulus for this novel was an\n1865 fan letter from a fellow writer, Madame George Sand. She praised\nVerne\u2019s two early novels Five Weeks in a Balloon (1863) and Journey to\nthe Center of the Earth (1864), then added: \u201cSoon I hope you\u2019ll take\nus into the ocean depths, your characters traveling in diving\nequipment perfected by your science and your imagination.\u201d Thus\ninspired, Verne created one of literature\u2019s great rebels, a freedom\nfighter who plunged beneath the waves to wage a unique form of\nguerilla warfare."}

He and I are old friends\u2014we grew up together in the same Nebraska\ntown\u2014and we had much to say to each other. While the train flashed\nthrough never-ending miles of ripe wheat, by country towns and\nbright-flowered pastures and oak groves wilting in the sun, we sat in\nthe observation car, where the woodwork was hot to the touch and red\ndust lay deep over everything. The dust and heat, the burning wind,\nreminded us of many things. We were talking about what it is like to\nspend one\u2019s childhood in little towns like these, buried in wheat and\ncorn, under stimulating extremes of climate: burning summers when the\nworld lies green and billowy beneath a brilliant sky, when one is\nfairly stifled in vegetation, in the color and smell of strong weeds\nand heavy harvests; blustery winters with little snow, when the whole\ncountry is stripped bare and gray as sheet-iron. We agreed that no one\nwho had not grown up in a little prairie town could know anything about\nit. It was a kind of freemasonry, we said.\n\nAlthough Jim Burden and I both live in New York, and are old friends, I\ndo not see much of him there. He is legal counsel for one of the great\nWestern railways, and is sometimes away from his New York office for\nweeks together. That is one reason why we do not often meet. Another is\nthat I do not like his wife.\n\nWhen Jim was still an obscure young lawyer, struggling to make his way\nin New York, his career was suddenly advanced by a brilliant marriage.\nGenevieve Whitney was the only daughter of a distinguished man. Her\nmarriage with young Burden was the subject of sharp comment at the\ntime. It was said she had been brutally jilted by her cousin, Rutland\nWhitney, and that she married this unknown man from the West out of\nbravado. She was a restless, headstrong girl, even then, who liked to\nastonish her friends. Later, when I knew her, she was always doing\nsomething unexpected. She gave one of her town houses for a Suffrage\nheadquarters, produced one of her own plays at the Princess Theater,\nwas arrested for picketing during a garment-makers\u2019 strike, etc. I am\nnever able to believe that she has much feeling for the causes to which\nshe lends her name and her fleeting interest. She is handsome,\nenergetic, executive, but to me she seems unimpressionable and\ntemperamentally incapable of enthusiasm. Her husband\u2019s quiet tastes\nirritate her, I think, and she finds it worth while to play the\npatroness to a group of young poets and painters of advanced ideas and\nmediocre ability. She has her own fortune and lives her own life. For\nsome reason, she wishes to remain Mrs. James Burden."}

He was in\nmy watch. A negro in a British forecastle is a lonely being. He has no\nchums. Yet James Wait, afraid of death and making her his accomplice\nwas an impostor of some character\u2014mastering our compassion, scornful of\nour sentimentalism, triumphing over our suspicions.\n\nBut in the book he is nothing; he is merely the centre of the ship\u2019s\ncollective psychology and the pivot of the action. Yet he, who in the\nfamily circle and amongst my friends is familiarly referred to as the\nNigger, remains very precious to me. For the book written round him\nis not the sort of thing that can be attempted more than once in a\nlife-time. It is the book by which, not as a novelist perhaps, but as\nan artist striving for the utmost sincerity of expression, I am willing\nto stand or fall. Its pages are the tribute of my unalterable and\nprofound affection for the ships, the seamen, the winds and the great\nsea\u2014the moulders of my youth, the companions of the best years of my\nlife.\n\nAfter writing the last words of that book, in the revulsion of feeling\nbefore the accomplished task, I understood that I had done with the\nsea, and that henceforth I had to be a writer. And almost without\nlaying down the pen I wrote a preface, trying to express the spirit\nin which I was entering on the task of my new life. That preface on\nadvice (which I now think was wrong) was never published with the book.\nBut the late W. E. Henley, who had the courage at that time (1897) to\nserialize my \u201cNigger\u201d in the New Review judged it worthy to be printed\nas an afterword at the end of the last instalment of the tale.\n\nI am glad that this book which means so much to me is coming out again,\nunder its proper title of \u201cThe Nigger of the \u2018Narcissus\u2019\u201d and under the\nauspices of my good friends and publishers Messrs. Doubleday, Page &\nCo. into the light of publicity.\n\nHalf the span of a generation has passed since W. E. Henley, after\nreading two chapters, sent me a verbal message: \u201cTell Conrad that if\nthe rest is up to the sample it shall certainly come out in the New\nReview.\u201d The most gratifying recollection of my writer\u2019s life!\n\nAnd here is the Suppressed Preface.\n\n1914.\n\nJOSEPH CONRAD.\n\nContents\n\nPREFACE\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nCHAPTER TWO\n\nCHAPTER THREE\n\nCHAPTER FOUR\n\nCHAPTER FIVE\n\nPREFACE\n\nA work that aspires, however humbly, to the condition of art should\ncarry its justification in every line. And art itself may be defined as\na single-minded attempt to render the highest kind of justice to the\nvisible universe, by bringing to light the truth, manifold and one,\nunderlying its every aspect. It is an attempt to find in its forms, in\nits colours, in its light, in its shadows, in the aspects of matter\nand in the facts of life what of each is fundamental, what is enduring\nand essential\u2014their one illuminating and convincing quality\u2014the very\ntruth of their existence. The artist, then, like the thinker or the\nscientist, seeks the truth and makes his appeal. Impressed by the\naspect of the world the thinker plunges into ideas, the scientist\ninto facts\u2014whence, presently, emerging they make their appeal to\nthose qualities of our being that fit us best for the hazardous\nenterprise of living. They speak authoritatively to our common-sense,\nto our intelligence, to our desire of peace or to our desire of\nunrest; not seldom to our prejudices, sometimes to our fears, often\nto our egoism\u2014but always to our credulity. And their words are heard\nwith reverence, for their concern is with weighty matters: with the\ncultivation of our minds and the proper care of our bodies, with the\nattainment of our ambitions, with the perfection of the means and the\nglorification of our precious aims."}

It was reported on good authority that he\nwas in receipt of one of the largest incomes derived from the practice\nof medicine in modern times.\n\nOne afternoon, towards the close of the London season, the Doctor had\njust taken his luncheon after a specially hard morning\u2019s work in his\nconsulting-room, and with a formidable list of visits to patients at\ntheir own houses to fill up the rest of his day\u2014when the servant\nannounced that a lady wished to speak to him.\n\n\u201cWho is she?\u201d the Doctor asked. \u201cA stranger?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see no strangers out of consulting-hours. Tell her what the hours\nare, and send her away.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have told her, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd she won\u2019t go.\u201d\n\n\u201cWon\u2019t go?\u201d The Doctor smiled as he repeated the words. He was a\nhumourist in his way; and there was an absurd side to the situation\nwhich rather amused him. \u201cHas this obstinate lady given you her name?\u201d\nhe inquired.\n\n\u201cNo, sir. She refused to give any name\u2014she said she wouldn\u2019t keep you\nfive minutes, and the matter was too important to wait till to-morrow.\nThere she is in the consulting-room; and how to get her out again is\nmore than I know.\u201d\n\nDoctor Wybrow considered for a moment. His knowledge of women\n(professionally speaking) rested on the ripe experience of more than\nthirty years; he had met with them in all their varieties\u2014especially\nthe variety which knows nothing of the value of time, and never\nhesitates at sheltering itself behind the privileges of its sex. A\nglance at his watch informed him that he must soon begin his rounds\namong the patients who were waiting for him at their own houses. He\ndecided forthwith on taking the only wise course that was open under\nthe circumstances. In other words, he decided on taking to flight.\n\n\u201cIs the carriage at the door?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well. Open the house-door for me without making any noise, and\nleave the lady in undisturbed possession of the consulting-room. When\nshe gets tired of waiting, you know what to tell her. If she asks when\nI am expected to return, say that I dine at my club, and spend the\nevening at the theatre. Now then, softly, Thomas! If your shoes creak,\nI am a lost man.\u201d"}

I was\nmade to suffer in consequence from several eminent pens.\n\nThat, however, was thirteen years ago, and, in respect of the first\nopinion, I venture to think that those who care to read the story now\nwill be quite astonished at the scrupulous propriety observed therein on\nthe relations of the sexes; for though there may be frivolous, and even\ngrotesque touches on occasion, there is hardly a single caress in the\nbook outside legal matrimony, or what was intended so to be.\n\nAs for the second opinion, it is sufficient to draw attention, as I did\nat the time, to the fact that the Bishop is every inch a gentleman, and\nthat the parish priest who figures in the narrative is one of its most\nestimable characters.\n\nHowever, the pages must speak for themselves.  Some few readers, I\ntrust--to take a serious view--will be reminded by this imperfect story,\nin a manner not unprofitable to the growth of the social sympathies, of\nthe pathos, misery, long-suffering, and divine tenderness which in real\nlife frequently accompany the passion of such a woman as Viviette for a\nlover several years her junior.\n\nThe scene of the action was suggested by two real spots in the part of\nthe country specified, each of which has a column standing upon it.\nCertain surrounding peculiarities have been imported into the narrative\nfrom both sites.\n\nT. H.\n\n_July_ 1895.\n\nTWO ON A TOWER.\n\nI\n\nOn an early winter afternoon, clear but not cold, when the vegetable\nworld was a weird multitude of skeletons through whose ribs the sun shone\nfreely, a gleaming landau came to a pause on the crest of a hill in\nWessex.  The spot was where the old Melchester Road, which the carriage\nhad hitherto followed, was joined by a drive that led round into a park\nat no great distance off."}

Rider Haggard\n\nFirst Published 1915.\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nBROTHER JOHN\n\nI do not suppose that anyone who knows the name of Allan Quatermain\nwould be likely to associate it with flowers, and especially with\norchids. Yet as it happens it was once my lot to take part in an orchid\nhunt of so remarkable a character that I think its details should not\nbe lost. At least I will set them down, and if in the after days anyone\ncares to publish them, well--he is at liberty to do so.\n\nIt was in the year--oh! never mind the year, it was a long while ago\nwhen I was much younger, that I went on a hunting expedition to the\nnorth of the Limpopo River which borders the Transvaal. My companion was\na gentleman of the name of Scroope, Charles Scroope. He had come out to\nDurban from England in search of sport. At least, that was one of his\nreasons. The other was a lady whom I will call Miss Margaret Manners,\nthough that was not her name.\n\nIt seems that these two were engaged to be married, and really attached\nto each other. Unfortunately, however, they quarrelled violently about\nanother gentleman with whom Miss Manners danced four consecutive dances,\nincluding two that were promised to her _fianc\u00e9_ at a Hunt ball in Essex,\nwhere they all lived. Explanations, or rather argument, followed. Mr.\nScroope said that he would not tolerate such conduct. Miss Manners\nreplied that she would not be dictated to; she was her own mistress and\nmeant to remain so. Mr. Scroope exclaimed that she might so far as he\nwas concerned. She answered that she never wished to see his face again.\nHe declared with emphasis that she never should and that he was going to\nAfrica to shoot elephants.\n\nWhat is more, he went, starting from his Essex home the next day without\nleaving any address. As it transpired afterwards, long afterwards, had\nhe waited till the post came in he would have received a letter that\nmight have changed his plans. But they were high-spirited young people,\nboth of them, and played the fool after the fashion of those in love.\n\nWell, Charles Scroope turned up in Durban, which was but a poor place\nthen, and there we met in the bar of the Royal Hotel.\n\n\u201cIf you want to kill big game,\u201d I heard some one say, who it was\nI really forget, \u201cthere\u2019s the man to show you how to do it--Hunter\nQuatermain; the best shot in Africa and one of the finest fellows, too.\u201d\n\nI sat still, smoking my pipe and pretending to hear nothing. It is\nawkward to listen to oneself being praised, and I was always a shy man.\n\nThen after a whispered colloquy Mr. Scroope was brought forward and\nintroduced to me. I bowed as nicely as I could and ran my eye over him.\nHe was a tall young man with dark eyes and a rather romantic aspect\n(that was due to his love affair), but I came to the conclusion that I\nliked the cut of his jib. When he spoke, that conclusion was affirmed. I\nalways think there is a great deal in a voice; personally, I judge by it\nalmost as much as by the face. This voice was particularly pleasant and\nsympathetic, though there was nothing very original or striking in the\nwords by which it was, so to speak, introduced to me. These were:"}

Houghton, Mifflin & Co., the authorized\n    publishers of Hawthorne's works._\n\nMCCLURE PRESS\n    New York City\n\n[Illustration: Nathaniel Hawthorne]\n\nIntroduction\n\nHawthorne made three collections of his short stories and sketches:\n\"Twice-Told Tales,\" \"Mosses from an Old Manse,\" and \"The Snow Image and\nOther Tales.\" The prefaces to these volumes express, with characteristic\ncharm, the author's dissatisfaction with his handiwork. No critic has\npointed out so clearly as Hawthorne himself the ineffectiveness of some\nof the \"Twice-Told Tales\"; he thinks that the \"Mosses from an Old Manse\"\nafford no solid basis for a literary reputation; and his comment upon\nthe earlier and later work gathered indiscriminately into his final\nvolume is that \"the ripened autumnal fruit tastes but little better than\nthe early windfalls.\"\n\nIt must be remembered that the collections were made in desultory\nfashion. They included some work that Hawthorne had outgrown even when\nthe first volume was published, such as elaborate exercises in\ndescription and fanciful allegories, excellently composed but without\nsubstance. Yet side by side with these proofs of his long, weary\napprenticeship are stories that reveal the consummate artist, mature in\nmind and heart, and with the sure hand of the master. The qualities of\nimagination and style that place Hawthorne easily first among American\nwriters of fiction are as readily discernible in his best brief tales as\nin his romances.\n\n\"Dr. Heidegger's Experiment,\" with which the present volume opens, is\nHawthorne's earliest treatment of the elixir of immortality theme, which\nhaunted him throughout his life and was the subject of the unfinished\nromance which rested upon his coffin. He handles it daintily, poetically\nhere, with an irony at once exquisite and profound. \"The Birthmark\"\nrepresents another favorite theme: the rivalry between scientific\npassion and human affection. It is not wholly free from the morbid fancy\nwhich Hawthorne occasionally betrays, and which allies him, on one side\nof his many-gifted mind, with Edgar Allan Poe; but the essential sanity\nof Hawthorne's moral, and the perfection of the workmanship, render \"The\nBirthmark\" worthy of its high place among modern short stories. \"Ethan\nBrand\" dates obviously from the sojourn at North Adams, Massachusetts,\ndescribed in the \"American Note-Book.\" Fragmentary as it is, it is one\nof Hawthorne's most powerful pieces of writing, the Unpardonable Sin\nwhich it portrays--the development of the intellect at the expense of\nthe heart--being one which the lonely romancer himself had had cause to\ndread. The motive of the humorous character sketch entitled \"Wakefield\"\nis somewhat similar: the danger of stepping aside, even for a moment,\nfrom one's allotted place. \"Drowne's Wooden Image\" is a charming old\nBoston version of the artistic miracles made possible by love. In \"The\nAmbitious Guest,\" the familiar story of the Willey House, in the Notch\nof the White Hills, is told with singular delicacy and imaginativeness,\nwhile \"The Great Stone Face,\" a parable after Hawthorne's own heart, is\nsuggested by a well-known phenomenon of the same mountainous region.\nHawthorne's numerous tales based upon New England history are\nrepresented by one of the briefest, \"The Gray Champion,\" whose succinct\nopening and eloquent close are no less admirable than the stern passion\nof its dramatic climax."}

Consider the case of Henry\nPifield Rice, detective.\n\nI must explain Henry early, to avoid disappointment. If I simply said\nhe was a detective, and let it go at that, I should be obtaining the\nreader's interest under false pretences. He was really only a sort of\ndetective, a species of sleuth. At Stafford's International\nInvestigation Bureau, in the Strand, where he was employed, they did\nnot require him to solve mysteries which had baffled the police. He had\nnever measured a footprint in his life, and what he did not know about\nbloodstains would have filled a library. The sort of job they gave\nHenry was to stand outside a restaurant in the rain, and note what time\nsomeone inside left it. In short, it is not 'Pifield Rice,\nInvestigator. No. 1.--The Adventure of the Maharajah's Ruby' that I\nsubmit to your notice, but the unsensational doings of a quite\ncommonplace young man, variously known to his comrades at the Bureau as\n'Fathead', 'That blighter what's-his-name', and 'Here, you!'\n\nHenry lived in a boarding-house in Guildford Street. One day a new girl\ncame to the boarding-house, and sat next to Henry at meals. Her name\nwas Alice Weston. She was small and quiet, and rather pretty. They got\non splendidly. Their conversation, at first confined to the weather and\nthe moving-pictures, rapidly became more intimate. Henry was surprised\nto find that she was on the stage, in the chorus. Previous chorus-girls\nat the boarding-house had been of a more pronounced type--good girls,\nbut noisy, and apt to wear beauty-spots. Alice Weston was different.\n\n'I'm rehearsing at present,' she said. 'I'm going out on tour next\nmonth in \"The Girl From Brighton\". What do you do, Mr Rice?'\n\nHenry paused for a moment before replying. He knew how sensational he\nwas going to be.\n\n'I'm a detective.'\n\nUsually, when he told girls his profession, squeaks of amazed\nadmiration greeted him. Now he was chagrined to perceive in the brown\neyes that met his distinct disapproval.\n\n'What's the matter?' he said, a little anxiously, for even at this\nearly stage in their acquaintance he was conscious of a strong desire\nto win her approval. 'Don't you like detectives?'\n\n'I don't know. Somehow I shouldn't have thought you were one.'\n\nThis restored Henry's equanimity somewhat. Naturally a detective does\nnot want to look like a detective and give the whole thing away right\nat the start.\n\n'I think--you won't be offended?'"}

The novelist\nhas spared no language\u2014has minced no words\u2014to describe the violent\nscenes of a violent time.\n\n\"In some instances facts appear distorted out of their true perspective,\nand in others the author makes unwarranted charges. It is not within our\nprovince to edit the historical side of Dumas, any more than it would be\nto correct the obvious errors in Dickens\u2019s Child\u2019s History of England.\nThe careful, mature reader, for whom the books are intended, will\nrecognize, and allow for, this fact.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe contents of these volumes of \u2019Celebrated Crimes\u2019, as well as the\nmotives which led to their inception, are unique. They are a series of\nstories based upon historical records, from the pen of Alexandre Dumas,\npere, when he was not \"the elder,\" nor yet the author of D\u2019Artagnan or\nMonte Cristo, but was a rising young dramatist and a lion in the\nliterary set and world of fashion.\n\nDumas, in fact, wrote his \u2019Crimes Celebres\u2019 just prior to launching upon\nhis wonderful series of historical novels, and they may therefore be\nconsidered as source books, whence he was to draw so much of that\nfar-reaching and intimate knowledge of inner history which has\nperennially astonished his readers. The Crimes were published in Paris,\nin 1839-40, in eight volumes, comprising eighteen titles\u2014all of which\nnow appear in the present carefully translated text. The success of the\noriginal work was instantaneous. Dumas laughingly said that he thought\nhe had exhausted the subject of famous crimes, until the work was off\nthe press, when he immediately became deluged with letters from every\nprovince in France, supplying him with material upon other deeds of\nviolence! The subjects which he has chosen, however, are of both\nhistoric and dramatic importance, and they have the added value of\ngiving the modern reader a clear picture of the state of\nsemi-lawlessness which existed in Europe, during the middle ages. \"The\nBorgias, the Cenci, Urbain Grandier, the Marchioness of Brinvilliers,\nthe Marchioness of Ganges, and the rest\u2014what subjects for the pen of\nDumas!\" exclaims Garnett."}

He had been conveyed by\nfriends an hour or two before to the house at which she was staying; the\nparty of visitors at the other house, of whom he was one, and thanks to\nwhom it was his theory, as always, that he was lost in the crowd, had\nbeen invited over to luncheon.  There had been after luncheon much\ndispersal, all in the interest of the original motive, a view of\nWeatherend itself and the fine things, intrinsic features, pictures,\nheirlooms, treasures of all the arts, that made the place almost famous;\nand the great rooms were so numerous that guests could wander at their\nwill, hang back from the principal group and in cases where they took\nsuch matters with the last seriousness give themselves up to mysterious\nappreciations and measurements.  There were persons to be observed,\nsingly or in couples, bending toward objects in out-of-the-way corners\nwith their hands on their knees and their heads nodding quite as with the\nemphasis of an excited sense of smell.  When they were two they either\nmingled their sounds of ecstasy or melted into silences of even deeper\nimport, so that there were aspects of the occasion that gave it for\nMarcher much the air of the \"look round,\" previous to a sale highly\nadvertised, that excites or quenches, as may be, the dream of\nacquisition.  The dream of acquisition at Weatherend would have had to be\nwild indeed, and John Marcher found himself, among such suggestions,\ndisconcerted almost equally by the presence of those who knew too much\nand by that of those who knew nothing.  The great rooms caused so much\npoetry and history to press upon him that he needed some straying apart\nto feel in a proper relation with them, though this impulse was not, as\nhappened, like the gloating of some of his companions, to be compared to\nthe movements of a dog sniffing a cupboard.  It had an issue promptly\nenough in a direction that was not to have been calculated.\n\nIt led, briefly, in the course of the October afternoon, to his closer\nmeeting with May Bartram, whose face, a reminder, yet not quite a\nremembrance, as they sat much separated at a very long table, had begun\nmerely by troubling him rather pleasantly.  It affected him as the sequel\nof something of which he had lost the beginning.  He knew it, and for the\ntime quite welcomed it, as a continuation, but didn't know what it\ncontinued, which was an interest or an amusement the greater as he was\nalso somehow aware--yet without a direct sign from her--that the young\nwoman herself hadn't lost the thread.  She hadn't lost it, but she\nwouldn't give it back to him, he saw, without some putting forth of his\nhand for it; and he not only saw that, but saw several things more,\nthings odd enough in the light of the fact that at the moment some\naccident of grouping brought them face to face he was still merely\nfumbling with the idea that any contact between them in the past would\nhave had no importance.  If it had had no importance he scarcely knew why\nhis actual impression of her should so seem to have so much; the answer\nto which, however, was that in such a life as they all appeared to be\nleading for the moment one could but take things as they came.  He was\nsatisfied, without in the least being able to say why, that this young\nlady might roughly have ranked in the house as a poor relation; satisfied\nalso that she was not there on a brief visit, but was more or less a part\nof the establishment--almost a working, a remunerated part.  Didn't she\nenjoy at periods a protection that she paid for by helping, among other\nservices, to show the place and explain it, deal with the tiresome\npeople, answer questions about the dates of the building, the styles of\nthe furniture, the authorship of the pictures, the favourite haunts of\nthe ghost?  It wasn't that she looked as if you could have given her\nshillings--it was impossible to look less so.  Yet when she finally\ndrifted toward him, distinctly handsome, though ever so much older--older\nthan when he had seen her before--it might have been as an effect of her\nguessing that he had, within the couple of hours, devoted more\nimagination to her than to all the others put together, and had thereby\npenetrated to a kind of truth that the others were too stupid for.  She\n_was_ there on harder terms than any one; she was there as a consequence\nof things suffered, one way and another, in the interval of years; and\nshe remembered him very much as she was remembered--only a good deal\nbetter."}

Hold the line a minute. I\u2019ve gone off the rails.\n\nI don\u2019t know if you have had the same experience, but the snag I always\ncome up against when I\u2019m telling a story is this dashed difficult\nproblem of where to begin it. It\u2019s a thing you don\u2019t want to go wrong\nover, because one false step and you\u2019re sunk. I mean, if you fool about\ntoo long at the start, trying to establish atmosphere, as they call it,\nand all that sort of rot, you fail to grip and the customers walk out\non you.\n\nGet off the mark, on the other hand, like a scalded cat, and your\npublic is at a loss.

And taking it for all in all and\nweighing this against that, I suppose the affair may be said to have\nhad its inception, if inception is the word I want, with that visit of\nmine to Cannes. If I hadn\u2019t gone to Cannes, I shouldn\u2019t have met the\nBassett or bought that white mess jacket, and Angela wouldn\u2019t have met\nher shark, and Aunt Dahlia wouldn\u2019t have played baccarat.\n\nYes, most decidedly, Cannes was the _point d\u2019appui_.\n\nRight ho, then. Let me marshal my facts.\n\nI went to Cannes--leaving Jeeves behind, he having intimated that he\ndid not wish to miss Ascot--round about the beginning of June. With\nme travelled my Aunt Dahlia and her daughter Angela. Tuppy Glossop,\nAngela\u2019s betrothed, was to have been of the party, but at the last\nmoment couldn\u2019t get away. Uncle Tom, Aunt Dahlia\u2019s husband, remained at\nhome, because he can\u2019t stick the South of France at any price.\n\nSo there you have the layout--Aunt Dahlia, Cousin Angela and self off\nto Cannes round about the beginning of June.\n\nAll pretty clear so far, what?\n\nWe stayed at Cannes about two months, and except for the fact that Aunt\nDahlia lost her shirt at baccarat and Angela nearly got inhaled by a\nshark while aquaplaning, a pleasant time was had by all.\n\nOn July the twenty-fifth, looking bronzed and fit, I accompanied aunt\nand child back to London. At seven p.m. on July the twenty-sixth we\nalighted at Victoria. And at seven-twenty or thereabouts we parted\nwith mutual expressions of esteem--they to shove off in Aunt Dahlia\u2019s\ncar to Brinkley Court, her place in Worcestershire, where they were\nexpecting to entertain Tuppy in a day or two; I to go to the flat, drop\nmy luggage, clean up a bit, and put on the soup and fish preparatory to\npushing round to the Drones for a bite of dinner."}

Nesbit\n\n\u201cIt may be said of Shakespeare, that from his works may be\n     collected a system of civil and economical prudence.  He has\n     been imitated by all succeeding writers; and it may be\n     doubted whether from all his successors more maxims of\n     theoretical knowledge, or more rules of practical prudence\n     can be collected than he alone has given to his country.\u201d--\n     Dr. SAMUEL JOHNSON.\n\nPREFACE\n\nThe writings of Shakespeare have been justly termed \u201cthe richest, the\npurest, the fairest, that genius uninspired ever penned.\u201d\n\nShakespeare instructed by delighting. His plays alone (leaving mere\nscience out of the question), contain more actual wisdom than the\nwhole body of English learning. He is the teacher of all good-- pity,\ngenerosity, true courage, love. His bright wit is cut out \u201cinto little\nstars.\u201d His solid masses of knowledge are meted out in morsels and\nproverbs, and thus distributed, there is scarcely a corner of the\nEnglish-speaking world to-day which he does not illuminate, or a cottage\nwhich he does not enrich. His bounty is like the sea, which, though\noften unacknowledged, is everywhere felt. As his friend, Ben Jonson,\nwrote of him, \u201cHe was not of an age but for all time.\u201d He ever kept the\nhighroad of human life whereon all travel. He did not pick out by-paths\nof feeling and sentiment. In his creations we have no moral highwaymen,\nsentimental thieves, interesting villains, and amiable, elegant\nadventuresses--no delicate entanglements of situation, in which\nthe grossest images are presented to the mind disguised under the\nsuperficial attraction of style and sentiment. He flattered no bad\npassion, disguised no vice in the garb of virtue, trifled with no just\nand generous principle. While causing us to laugh at folly, and shudder\nat crime, he still preserves our love for our fellow-beings, and our\nreverence for ourselves.\n\nShakespeare was familiar with all beautiful forms and images, with\nall that is sweet or majestic in the simple aspects of nature, of\nthat indestructible love of flowers and fragrance, and dews, and\nclear waters--and soft airs and sounds, and bright skies and woodland\nsolitudes, and moon-light bowers, which are the material elements of\npoetry,--and with that fine sense of their indefinable relation to\nmental emotion, which is its essence and vivifying soul--and which, in\nthe midst of his most busy and tragical scenes, falls like gleams of\nsunshine on rocks and ruins--contrasting with all that is rugged or\nrepulsive, and reminding us of the existence of purer and brighter\nelements.\n\nThese things considered, what wonder is it that the works of\nShakespeare, next to the Bible, are the most highly esteemed of all the\nclassics of English literature. \u201cSo extensively have the characters of\nShakespeare been drawn upon by artists, poets, and writers of fiction,\u201d\n says an American author,--\u201cSo interwoven are these characters in the\ngreat body of English literature, that to be ignorant of the plot of\nthese dramas is often a cause of embarrassment.\u201d"}

The most\nmacabre and imaginative of plotters would hesitate before linking his\nmorbid fancies with the unquestioned and tragic facts which reinforce\nthe statement.  Though the assertions contained in it are amazing and\neven monstrous, it is none the less forcing itself upon the general\nintelligence that they are true, and that we must readjust our ideas to\nthe new situation.  This world of ours appears to be separated by a\nslight and precarious margin of safety from a most singular and\nunexpected danger.  I will endeavour in this narrative, which\nreproduces the original document in its necessarily somewhat\nfragmentary form, to lay before the reader the whole of the facts up to\ndate, prefacing my statement by saying that, if there be any who doubt\nthe narrative of Joyce-Armstrong, there can be no question at all as to\nthe facts concerning Lieutenant Myrtle, R. N., and Mr. Hay Connor, who\nundoubtedly met their end in the manner described.\n\nThe Joyce-Armstrong Fragment was found in the field which is called\nLower Haycock, lying one mile to the westward of the village of\nWithyham, upon the Kent and Sussex border.  It was on the 15th\nSeptember last that an agricultural labourer, James Flynn, in the\nemployment of Mathew Dodd, farmer, of the Chauntry Farm, Withyham,\nperceived a briar pipe lying near the footpath which skirts the hedge\nin Lower Haycock.  A few paces farther on he picked up a pair of broken\nbinocular glasses.  Finally, among some nettles in the ditch, he caught\nsight of a flat, canvas-backed book, which proved to be a note-book\nwith detachable leaves, some of which had come loose and were\nfluttering along the base of the hedge.  These he collected, but some,\nincluding the first, were never recovered, and leave a deplorable\nhiatus in this all-important statement.  The note-book was taken by the\nlabourer to his master, who in turn showed it to Dr. J. H. Atherton, of\nHartfield.  This gentleman at once recognized the need for an expert\nexamination, and the manuscript was forwarded to the Aero Club in\nLondon, where it now lies.\n\nThe first two pages of the manuscript are missing.  There is also one\ntorn away at the end of the narrative, though none of these affect the\ngeneral coherence of the story.  It is conjectured that the missing\nopening is concerned with the record of Mr. Joyce-Armstrong's\nqualifications as an aeronaut, which can be gathered from other sources\nand are admitted to be unsurpassed among the air-pilots of England.\nFor many years he has been looked upon as among the most daring and the\nmost intellectual of flying men, a combination which has enabled him to\nboth invent and test several new devices, including the common\ngyroscopic attachment which is known by his name.  The main body of the\nmanuscript is written neatly in ink, but the last few lines are in\npencil and are so ragged as to be hardly legible--exactly, in fact, as\nthey might be expected to appear if they were scribbled off hurriedly\nfrom the seat of a moving aeroplane.  There are, it may be added,\nseveral stains, both on the last page and on the outside cover which\nhave been pronounced by the Home Office experts to be blood--probably\nhuman and certainly mammalian.  The fact that something closely\nresembling the organism of malaria was discovered in this blood, and\nthat Joyce-Armstrong is known to have suffered from intermittent fever,\nis a remarkable example of the new weapons which modern science has\nplaced in the hands of our detectives."}

The nature of my avocations for the last\nthirty years has brought me into more than ordinary contact with what\nwould seem an interesting and somewhat singular set of men, of whom as\nyet nothing that I know of has ever been written:\u2014I mean the\nlaw-copyists or scriveners. I have known very many of them,\nprofessionally and privately, and if I pleased, could relate divers\nhistories, at which good-natured gentlemen might smile, and sentimental\nsouls might weep. But I waive the biographies of all other scriveners\nfor a few passages in the life of Bartleby, who was a scrivener of the\nstrangest I ever saw or heard of. While of other law-copyists I might\nwrite the complete life, of Bartleby nothing of that sort can be done.\nI believe that no materials exist for a full and satisfactory biography\nof this man. It is an irreparable loss to literature. Bartleby was one\nof those beings of whom nothing is ascertainable, except from the\noriginal sources, and in his case those are very small. What my own\nastonished eyes saw of Bartleby, _that_ is all I know of him, except,\nindeed, one vague report which will appear in the sequel.\n\nEre introducing the scrivener, as he first appeared to me, it is fit I\nmake some mention of myself, my employ\u00e9s, my business, my chambers, and\ngeneral surroundings; because some such description is indispensable to\nan adequate understanding of the chief character about to be presented.\n\nImprimis: I am a man who, from his youth upwards, has been filled with\na profound conviction that the easiest way of life is the best. Hence,\nthough I belong to a profession proverbially energetic and nervous,\neven to turbulence, at times, yet nothing of that sort have I ever\nsuffered to invade my peace. I am one of those unambitious lawyers who\nnever addresses a jury, or in any way draws down public applause; but\nin the cool tranquility of a snug retreat, do a snug business among\nrich men\u2019s bonds and mortgages and title-deeds. All who know me,\nconsider me an eminently _safe_ man. The late John Jacob Astor, a\npersonage little given to poetic enthusiasm, had no hesitation in\npronouncing my first grand point to be prudence; my next, method. I do\nnot speak it in vanity, but simply record the fact, that I was not\nunemployed in my profession by the late John Jacob Astor; a name which,\nI admit, I love to repeat, for it hath a rounded and orbicular sound to\nit, and rings like unto bullion. I will freely add, that I was not\ninsensible to the late John Jacob Astor\u2019s good opinion.\n\nSome time prior to the period at which this little history begins, my\navocations had been largely increased. The good old office, now extinct\nin the State of New York, of a Master in Chancery, had been conferred\nupon me. It was not a very arduous office, but very pleasantly\nremunerative. I seldom lose my temper; much more seldom indulge in\ndangerous indignation at wrongs and outrages; but I must be permitted\nto be rash here and declare, that I consider the sudden and violent\nabrogation of the office of Master in Chancery, by the new\nConstitution, as a\u2014premature act; inasmuch as I had counted upon a\nlife-lease of the profits, whereas I only received those of a few short\nyears. But this is by the way."}

The sound of a piano is heard\nin the adjoining room.\n\n[Lane is arranging afternoon tea on the table, and after the music has\nceased, Algernon enters.]\n\nALGERNON.\nDid you hear what I was playing, Lane?\n\nLANE.\nI didn\u2019t think it polite to listen, sir.\n\nALGERNON.\nI\u2019m sorry for that, for your sake. I don\u2019t play accurately\u2014any one can\nplay accurately\u2014but I play with wonderful expression. As far as the\npiano is concerned, sentiment is my forte. I keep science for Life.\n\nLANE.\nYes, sir.\n\nALGERNON.\nAnd, speaking of the science of Life, have you got the cucumber\nsandwiches cut for Lady Bracknell?\n\nLANE.\nYes, sir. [Hands them on a salver.]\n\nALGERNON.\n[Inspects them, takes two, and sits down on the sofa.] Oh! . . . by the\nway, Lane, I see from your book that on Thursday night, when Lord\nShoreman and Mr. Worthing were dining with me, eight bottles of\nchampagne are entered as having been consumed.\n\nLANE.\nYes, sir; eight bottles and a pint.\n\nALGERNON.\nWhy is it that at a bachelor\u2019s establishment the servants invariably\ndrink the champagne? I ask merely for information.\n\nLANE.\nI attribute it to the superior quality of the wine, sir. I have often\nobserved that in married households the champagne is rarely of a\nfirst-rate brand.\n\nALGERNON.\nGood heavens! Is marriage so demoralising as that?\n\nLANE.\nI believe it _is_ a very pleasant state, sir. I have had very little\nexperience of it myself up to the present. I have only been married\nonce. That was in consequence of a misunderstanding between myself and\na young person.\n\nALGERNON.\n[Languidly_._] I don\u2019t know that I am much interested in your family\nlife, Lane.\n\nLANE.\nNo, sir; it is not a very interesting subject. I never think of it\nmyself.\n\nALGERNON.\nVery natural, I am sure. That will do, Lane, thank you.\n\nLANE.\nThank you, sir. [Lane goes out.]\n\nALGERNON.\nLane\u2019s views on marriage seem somewhat lax. Really, if the lower orders\ndon\u2019t set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them? They\nseem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility."}

The dates of their writing are far apart, their\n      origins are various. None of them are connected directly with personal\n      experiences. In all of them the facts are inherently true, by which I mean\n      that they are not only possible but that they have actually happened. For\n      instance, the last story in the volume, the one I call Pathetic, whose\n      first title is Il Conde (misspelt by-the-by) is an almost verbatim\n      transcript of the tale told me by a very charming old gentleman whom I met\n      in Italy. I don&rsquo;t mean to say it is only that. Anybody can see that it is\n      something more than a verbatim report, but where he left off and where I\n      began must be left to the acute discrimination of the reader who may be\n      interested in the problem. I don&rsquo;t mean to say that the problem is worth\n      the trouble. What I am certain of, however, is that it is not to be\n      solved, for I am not at all clear about it myself by this time. All I can\n      say is that the personality of the narrator was extremely suggestive quite\n      apart from the story he was telling me. I heard a few years ago that he\n      had died far away from his beloved Naples where that &ldquo;abominable\n      adventure&rdquo; did really happen to him.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Thus the genealogy of Il Conde is simple. It is not the case with the\n      other stories. Various strains contributed to their composition, and the\n      nature of many of those I have forgotten, not having the habit of making\n      notes either before or after the fact. I mean the fact of writing a story.\n      What I remember best about Gaspar Ruiz is that it was written, or at any\n      rate begun, within a month of finishing Nostromo; but apart from the\n      locality, and that a pretty wide one (all the South American Continent),\n      the novel and the story have nothing in common, neither mood, nor\n      intention and, certainly, not the style. The manner for the most part is\n      that of General Santierra, and that old warrior, I note with satisfaction,\n      is very true to himself all through. Looking now dispassionately at the\n      various ways in which this story could have been presented I can&rsquo;t\n      honestly think the General superfluous. It is he, an old man talking of\n      the days of his youth, who characterizes the whole narrative and gives it\n      an air of actuality which I doubt whether I could have achieved without\n      his help. In the mere writing his existence of course was of no help at\n      all, because the whole thing had to be carefully kept within the frame of\n      his simple mind. But all this is but a laborious searching of memories. My\n      present feeling is that the story could not have been told otherwise. The\n      hint for Gaspar Ruiz the man I found in a book by Captain Basil Hall,\n      R.N., who was for some time, between the years 1824 and 1828, senior\n      officer of a small British Squadron on the West Coast of South America.\n      His book published in the thirties obtained a certain celebrity and I\n      suppose is to be found still in some libraries. The curious who may be\n      mistrusting my imagination are referred to that printed document, Vol. II,\n      I forget the page, but it is somewhere not far from the end. Another\n      document connected with this story is a letter of a biting and ironic kind\n      from a friend then in Burma, passing certain strictures upon &ldquo;the\n      gentleman with the gun on his back&rdquo; which I do not intend to make\n      accessible to the public. Yet the gun episode did really happen, or at\n      least I am bound to believe it because I remember it, described in an\n      extremely matter-of-fact tone, in some book I read in my boyhood; and I am\n      not going to discard the beliefs of my boyhood for anybody on earth.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The Brute, which is the only sea-story in the volume, is, like Il Conde,\n      associated with a direct narrative and based on a suggestion gathered on\n      warm human lips. I will not disclose the real name of the criminal ship\n      but the first I heard of her homicidal habits was from the late Captain\n      Blake, commanding a London ship in which I served in 1884 as Second\n      Officer. Captain Blake was, of all my commanders, the one I remember with\n      the greatest affection. I have sketched in his personality, without\n      however mentioning his name, in the first paper of The Mirror of the Sea.\n      In his young days he had had a personal experience of the brute and it is\n      perhaps for that reason that I have put the story into the mouth of a\n      young man and made of it what the reader will see. The existence of the\n      brute was a fact. The end of the brute as related in the story is also a\n      fact, well-known at the time though it really happened to another ship, of\n      great beauty of form and of blameless character, which certainly deserved\n      a better fate. I have unscrupulously adapted it to the needs of my story\n      thinking that I had there something in the nature of poetical justice. I\n      hope that little villainy will not cast a shadow upon the general honesty\n      of my proceedings as a writer of tales.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Of The Informer and An Anarchist I will say next to nothing. The pedigree\n      of these tales is hopelessly complicated and not worth disentangling at\n      this distance of time. I found them and here they are. The discriminating\n      reader will guess that I have found them within my mind; but how they or\n      their elements came in there I have forgotten for the most part; and for\n      the rest I really don&rsquo;t see why I should give myself away more than I have\n      done already.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      It remains for me only now to mention The Duel, the longest story in the\n      book. That story attained the dignity of publication all by itself in a\n      small illustrated volume, under the title, &ldquo;The Point of Honour.&rdquo; That was\n      many years ago. It has been since reinstated in its proper place, which is\n      the place it occupies in this volume, in all the subsequent editions of my\n      work. Its pedigree is extremely simple. It springs from a ten-line\n      paragraph in a small provincial paper published in the South of France.\n      That paragraph, occasioned by a duel with a fatal ending between two\n      well-known Parisian personalities, referred for some reason or other to\n      the &ldquo;well-known fact&rdquo; of two officers in Napoleon&rsquo;s Grand Army having\n      fought a series of duels in the midst of great wars and on some futile\n      pretext. The pretext was never disclosed. I had therefore to invent it;\n      and I think that, given the character of the two officers which I had to\n      invent, too, I have made it sufficiently convincing by the mere force of\n      its absurdity. The truth is that in my mind the story is nothing but a\n      serious and even earnest attempt at a bit of historical fiction. I had\n      heard in my boyhood a good deal of the great Napoleonic legend. I had a\n      genuine feeling that I would find myself at home in it, and The Duel is\n      the result of that feeling, or, if the reader prefers, of that\n      presumption. Personally I have no qualms of conscience about this piece of\n      work. The story might have been better told of course. All one&rsquo;s work\n      might have been better done; but this is the sort of reflection a worker\n      must put aside courageously if he doesn&rsquo;t mean every one of his\n      conceptions to remain for ever a private vision, an evanescent reverie.\n      How many of those visions have I seen vanish in my time! This one,\n      however, has remained, a testimony, if you like, to my courage or a proof\n      of my rashness. What I care to remember best is the testimony of some\n      French readers who volunteered the opinion that in those hundred pages or\n      so I had managed to render &ldquo;wonderfully&rdquo; the spirit of the whole epoch.\n      Exaggeration of kindness no doubt; but even so I hug it still to my\n      breast, because in truth that is exactly what I was trying to capture in\n      my small net: the Spirit of the Epoch&mdash;never purely militarist in the\n      long clash of arms, youthful, almost childlike in its exaltation of\n      sentiment&mdash;naively heroic in its faith.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      1920.

The names of a few leaders\n      alone survive the end of armed strife and are further preserved in\n      history; so that, vanishing from men&rsquo;s active memories, they still exist\n      in books.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The name of General Santierra attained that cold paper-and-ink\n      immortality. He was a South American of good family, and the books\n      published in his lifetime numbered him amongst the liberators of that\n      continent from the oppressive rule of Spain.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      That long contest, waged for independence on one side and for dominion on\n      the other, developed in the course of years and the vicissitudes of\n      changing fortune the fierceness and inhumanity of a struggle for life. All\n      feelings of pity and compassion disappeared in the growth of political\n      hatred. And, as is usual in war, the mass of the people, who had the least\n      to gain by the issue, suffered most in their obscure persons and their\n      humble fortunes.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      General Santierra began his service as lieutenant in the patriot army\n      raised and commanded by the famous San Martin, afterwards conqueror of\n      Lima and liberator of Peru. A great battle had just been fought on the\n      banks of the river Bio-Bio. Amongst the prisoners made upon the routed\n      Royalist troops there was a soldier called Gaspar Ruiz. His powerful build\n      and his big head rendered him remarkable amongst his fellow-captives. The\n      personality of the man was unmistakable. Some months before he had been\n      missed from the ranks of Republican troops after one of the many\n      skirmishes which preceded the great battle. And now, having been captured\n      arms in hand amongst Royalists, he could expect no other fate but to be\n      shot as a deserter.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Gaspar Ruiz, however, was not a deserter; his mind was hardly active\n      enough to take a discriminating view of the advantages or perils of\n      treachery. Why should he change sides? He had really been made a prisoner,\n      had suffered ill-usage and many privations. Neither side showed tenderness\n      to its adversaries. There came a day when he was ordered, together with\n      some other captured rebels, to march in the front rank of the Royal\n      troops. A musket had been thrust into his hands. He had taken it. He had\n      marched. He did not want to be killed with circumstances of peculiar\n      atrocity for refusing to march. He did not understand heroism but it was\n      his intention to throw his musket away at the first opportunity. Meantime\n      he had gone on loading and firing, from fear of having his brains blown\n      out at the first sign of unwillingness, by some non-commissioned officer\n      of the King of Spain. He tried to set forth these elementary\n      considerations before the sergeant of the guard set over him and some\n      twenty other such deserters, who had been condemned summarily to be shot.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      It was in the quadrangle of the fort at the back of the batteries which\n      command the roadstead of Valparaiso. The officer who had identified him\n      had gone on without listening to his protestations. His doom was sealed;\n      his hands were tied very tightly together behind his back; his body was\n      sore all over from the many blows with sticks and butts of muskets which\n      had hurried him along on the painful road from the place of his capture to\n      the gate of the fort. This was the only kind of systematic attention the\n      prisoners had received from their escort during a four days&rsquo; journey\n      across a scantily watered tract of country. At the crossings of rare\n      streams they were permitted to quench their thirst by lapping hurriedly\n      like dogs. In the evening a few scraps of meat were thrown amongst them as\n      they dropped down dead-beat upon the stony ground of the halting-place.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      As he stood in the courtyard of the castle in the early morning, after\n      having been driven hard all night, Gaspar Ruiz&rsquo;s throat was parched, and\n      his tongue felt very large and dry in his mouth.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      And Gaspar Ruiz, besides being very thirsty, was stirred by a feeling of\n      sluggish anger, which he could not very well express, as though the vigour\n      of his spirit were by no means equal to the strength of his body.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The other prisoners in the batch of the condemned hung their heads,\n      looking obstinately on the ground. But Gaspar Ruiz kept on repeating:\n      &ldquo;What should I desert for to the Royalists? Why should I desert? Tell me,\n      Estaban!&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      He addressed himself to the sergeant, who happened to belong to the same\n      part of the country as himself. But the sergeant, after shrugging his\n      meagre shoulders once, paid no further attention to the deep murmuring\n      voice at his back. It was indeed strange that Gaspar Ruiz should desert.\n      His people were in too humble a station to feel much the disadvantages of\n      any form of government. There was no reason why Gaspar Ruiz should wish to\n      uphold in his own person the rule of the King of Spain. Neither had he\n      been anxious to exert himself for its subversion. He had joined the side\n      of Independence in an extremely reasonable and natural manner. A band of\n      patriots appeared one morning early, surrounding his father&rsquo;s ranche,\n      spearing the watch-dogs and ham-stringing a fat cow all in the twinkling\n      of an eye, to the cries of &ldquo;Viva la Libertad!&rdquo; Their officer discoursed of\n      Liberty with enthusiasm and eloquence after a long and refreshing sleep.\n      When they left in the evening, taking with them some of Ruiz, the\n      father&rsquo;s, best horses to replace their own lamed animals, Gaspar Ruiz went\n      away with them, having been invited pressingly to do so by the eloquent\n      officer.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Shortly afterwards a detachment of Royalist troops coming to pacify the\n      district, burnt the ranche, carried off the remaining horses and cattle,\n      and having thus deprived the old people of all their worldly possessions,\n      left them sitting under a bush in the enjoyment of the inestimable boon of\n      life.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      II\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Gaspar Ruiz, condemned to death as a deserter, was not thinking either of\n      his native place or of his parents, to whom he had been a good son on\n      account of the mildness of his character and the great strength of his\n      limbs. The practical advantage of this last was made still more valuable\n      to his father by his obedient disposition. Gaspar Ruiz had an acquiescent\n      soul.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      But it was stirred now to a sort of dim revolt by his dislike to die the\n      death of a traitor. He was not a traitor. He said again to the sergeant:\n      &ldquo;You know I did not desert, Estaban. You know I remained behind amongst\n      the trees with three others to keep the enemy back while the detachment\n      was running away!&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Lieutenant Santierra, little more than a boy at the time, and unused as\n      yet to the sanguinary imbecilities of a state of war, had lingered near\n      by, as if fascinated by the sight of these men who were to be shot\n      presently&mdash;&ldquo;for an example&rdquo;&mdash;as the Commandante had said.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The sergeant, without deigning to look at the prisoner, addressed himself\n      to the young officer with a superior smile.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Ten men would not have been enough to make him a prisoner, mi teniente.\n      Moreover, the other three rejoined the detachment after dark. Why should\n      he, unwounded and the strongest of them all, have failed to do so?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;My strength is as nothing against a mounted man with a lasso,&rdquo; Gaspar\n      Ruiz protested, eagerly. &ldquo;He dragged me behind his horse for half a mile.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      At this excellent reason the sergeant only laughed contemptuously. The\n      young officer hurried away after the Commandante.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Presently the adjutant of the castle came by. He was a truculent,\n      raw-boned man in a ragged uniform. His spluttering voice issued out of a\n      flat yellow face. The sergeant learned from him that the condemned men\n      would not be shot till sunset. He begged then to know what he was to do\n      with them meantime.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The adjutant looked savagely round the courtyard and, pointing to the door\n      of a small dungeon-like guardroom, receiving light and air through one\n      heavily barred window, said: &ldquo;Drive the scoundrels in there.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The sergeant, tightening his grip upon the stick he carried in virtue of\n      his rank, executed this order with alacrity and zeal. He hit Gaspar Ruiz,\n      whose movements were slow, over his head and shoulders. Gaspar Ruiz stood\n      still for a moment under the shower of blows, biting his lip thoughtfully\n      as if absorbed by a perplexing mental process&mdash;then followed the\n      others without haste. The door was locked, and the adjutant carried off\n      the key.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      By noon the heat of that vaulted place crammed to suffocation had become\n      unbearable. The prisoners crowded towards the window, begging their guards\n      for a drop of water; but the soldiers remained lying in indolent attitudes\n      wherever there was a little shade under a wall, while the sentry sat with\n      his back against the door smoking a cigarette, and raising his eyebrows\n      philosophically from time to time. Gaspar Ruiz had pushed his way to the\n      window with irresistible force. His capacious chest needed more air than\n      the others; his big face, resting with its chin on the ledge, pressed\n      close to the bars, seemed to support the other faces crowding up for\n      breath. From moaned entreaties they had passed to desperate cries, and the\n      tumultuous howling of those thirsty men obliged a young officer who was\n      just then crossing the courtyard to shout in order to make himself heard.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you give some water to these prisoners?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The sergeant, with an air of surprised innocence, excused himself by the\n      remark that all those men were condemned to die in a very few hours.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Lieutenant Santierra stamped his foot. &ldquo;They are condemned to death, not\n      to torture,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Give them some water at once.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Impressed by this appearance of anger, the soldiers bestirred themselves,\n      and the sentry, snatching up his musket, stood to attention.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      But when a couple of buckets were found and filled from the well, it was\n      discovered that they could not be passed through the bars, which were set\n      too close. At the prospect of quenching their thirst, the shrieks of those\n      trampled down in the struggle to get near the opening became very\n      heartrending. But when the soldiers who had lifted the buckets towards the\n      window put them to the ground again helplessly, the yell of disappointment\n      was still more terrible.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The soldiers of the army of Independence were not equipped with canteens.\n      A small tin cup was found, but its approach to the opening caused such a\n      commotion, such yells of rage and pain in the vague mass of limbs behind\n      the straining faces at the window, that Lieutenant Santierra cried out\n      hurriedly, &ldquo;No, no&mdash;you must open the door, sergeant.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The sergeant, shrugging his shoulders, explained that he had no right to\n      open the door even if he had had the key. But he had not the key. The\n      adjutant of the garrison kept the key. Those men were giving much\n      unnecessary trouble, since they had to die at sunset in any case. Why they\n      had not been shot at once early in the morning he could not understand.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Lieutenant Santierra kept his back studiously to the window. It was at his\n      earnest solicitations that the Commandante had delayed the execution. This\n      favour had been granted to him in consideration of his distinguished\n      family and of his father&rsquo;s high position amongst the chiefs of the\n      Republican party. Lieutenant Santierra believed that the General\n      commanding would visit the fort some time in the afternoon, and he\n      ingenuously hoped that his naive intercession would induce that severe man\n      to pardon some, at least, of those criminals. In the revulsion of his\n      feeling his interference stood revealed now as guilty and futile meddling.\n      It appeared to him obvious that the general would never even consent to\n      listen to his petition. He could never save those men, and he had only\n      made himself responsible for the sufferings added to the cruelty of their\n      fate.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Then go at once and get the key from the adjutant,&rdquo; said Lieutenant\n      Santierra.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The sergeant shook his head with a sort of bashful smile, while his eyes\n      glanced sideways at Gaspar Ruiz&rsquo;s face, motionless and silent, staring\n      through the bars at the bottom of a heap of other haggard, distorted,\n      yelling faces.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      His worship the adjutant de Plaza, the sergeant murmured, was having his\n      siesta; and supposing that he, the sergeant, would be allowed access to\n      him, the only result he expected would be to have his soul flogged out of\n      his body for presuming to disturb his worship&rsquo;s repose. He made a\n      deprecatory movement with his hands, and stood stock-still, looking down\n      modestly upon his brown toes.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Lieutenant Santierra glared with indignation, but hesitated. His handsome\n      oval face, as smooth as a girl&rsquo;s, flushed with the shame of his\n      perplexity. Its nature humiliated his spirit. His hairless upper lip\n      trembled; he seemed on the point of either bursting into a fit of rage or\n      into tears of dismay.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Fifty years later, General Santierra, the venerable relic of revolutionary\n      times, was well able to remember the feelings of the young lieutenant.\n      Since he had given up riding altogether, and found it difficult to walk\n      beyond the limits of his garden, the general&rsquo;s greatest delight was to\n      entertain in his house the officers of the foreign men-of-war visiting the\n      harbour. For Englishmen he had a preference, as for old companions in\n      arms. English naval men of all ranks accepted his hospitality with\n      curiosity, because he had known Lord Cochrane and had taken part, on board\n      the patriot squadron commanded by that marvellous seaman, in the cutting\n      out and blockading operations before Callao&mdash;an episode of unalloyed\n      glory in the wars of Independence and of endless honour in the fighting\n      tradition of Englishmen. He was a fair linguist, this ancient survivor of\n      the Liberating armies. A trick of smoothing his long white beard whenever\n      he was short of a word in French or English imparted an air of leisurely\n      dignity to the tone of his reminiscences.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      III\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Yes, my friends,&rdquo; he used to say to his guests, &ldquo;what would you have? A\n      youth of seventeen summers, without worldly experience, and owing my rank\n      only to the glorious patriotism of my father, may God rest his soul. I\n      suffered immense humiliation, not so much from the disobedience of that\n      subordinate, who, after all, was responsible for those prisoners; but I\n      suffered because, like the boy I was, I myself dreaded going to the\n      adjutant for the key. I had felt, before, his rough and cutting tongue.\n      Being quite a common fellow, with no merit except his savage valour, he\n      made me feel his contempt and dislike from the first day I joined my\n      battalion in garrison at the fort. It was only a fortnight before! I would\n      have confronted him sword in hand, but I shrank from the mocking brutality\n      of his sneers.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember having been so miserable in my life before or since. The\n      torment of my sensibility was so great that I wished the sergeant to fall\n      dead at my feet, and the stupid soldiers who stared at me to turn into\n      corpses; and even those wretches for whom my entreaties had procured a\n      reprieve I wished dead also, because I could not face them without shame.\n      A mephitic heat like a whiff of air from hell came out of that dark place\n      in which they were confined. Those at the window who had heard what was\n      going on jeered at me in very desperation: one of these fellows, gone mad\n      no doubt, kept on urging me volubly to order the soldiers to fire through\n      the window. His insane loquacity made my heart turn faint. And my feet\n      were like lead. There was no higher officer to whom I could appeal. I had\n      not even the firmness of spirit to simply go away.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Benumbed by my remorse, I stood with my back to the window. You must not\n      suppose that all this lasted a long time. How long could it have been? A\n      minute? If you measured by mental suffering it was like a hundred years; a\n      longer time than all my life has been since. No, certainly, it was not so\n      much as a minute. The hoarse screaming of those miserable wretches died\n      out in their dry throats, and then suddenly a voice spoke, a deep voice\n      muttering calmly. It called upon me to turn round.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;That voice, senores, proceeded from the head of Gaspar Ruiz. Of his body\n      I could see nothing. Some of his fellow-captives had clambered upon his\n      back. He was holding them up. His eyes blinked without looking at me. That\n      and the moving of his lips was all he seemed able to manage in his\n      overloaded state. And when I turned round, this head, that seemed more\n      than human size resting on its chin under a multitude of other heads,\n      asked me whether I really desired to quench the thirst of the captives.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I said, &lsquo;Yes, yes!&rsquo; eagerly, and came up quite close to the window. I was\n      like a child, and did not know what would happen. I was anxious to be\n      comforted in my helplessness and remorse.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Have you the authority, Senor teniente, to release my wrists from their\n      bonds?&rsquo; Gaspar Ruiz&rsquo;s head asked me.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;His features expressed no anxiety, no hope; his heavy eyelids blinked\n      upon his eyes that looked past me straight into the courtyard.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;As if in an ugly dream, I spoke, stammering: &lsquo;What do you mean? And how\n      can I reach the bonds on your wrists?&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;I will try what I can do,&rsquo; he said; and then that large staring head\n      moved at last, and all the wild faces piled up in that window disappeared,\n      tumbling down. He had shaken his load off with one movement, so strong he\n      was.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;And he had not only shaken it off, but he got free of the crush and\n      vanished from my sight. For a moment there was no one at all to be seen at\n      the window. He had swung about, butting and shouldering, clearing a space\n      for himself in the only way he could do it with his hands tied behind his\n      back.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Finally, backing to the opening, he pushed out to me between the bars his\n      wrists, lashed with many turns of rope. His hands, very swollen, with\n      knotted veins, looked enormous and unwieldy. I saw his bent back. It was\n      very broad. His voice was like the muttering of a bull.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Cut, Senor teniente. Cut!&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I drew my sword, my new unblunted sword that had seen no service as yet,\n      and severed the many turns of the hide rope. I did this without knowing\n      the why and the wherefore of my action, but as it were compelled by my\n      faith in that man. The sergeant made as if to cry out, but astonishment\n      deprived him of his voice, and he remained standing with his mouth open as\n      if overtaken by sudden imbecility.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I sheathed my sword and faced the soldiers. An air of awestruck\n      expectation had replaced their usual listless apathy. I heard the voice of\n      Gaspar Ruiz shouting inside, but the words I could not make out plainly. I\n      suppose that to see him with his arms free augmented the influence of his\n      strength: I mean by this, the spiritual influence that with ignorant\n      people attaches to an exceptional degree of bodily vigour. In fact, he was\n      no more to be feared than before, on account of the numbness of his arms\n      and hands, which lasted for some time.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The sergeant had recovered his power of speech. &lsquo;By all the saints!&rsquo; he\n      cried, &lsquo;we shall have to get a cavalry man with a lasso to secure him\n      again, if he is to be led to the place of execution. Nothing less than a\n      good enlazador on a good horse can subdue him. Your worship was pleased to\n      perform a very mad thing.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I had nothing to say. I was surprised myself, and I felt a childish\n      curiosity to see what would happen next. But the sergeant was thinking of\n      the difficulty of controlling Gaspar Ruiz when the time for making an\n      example would come.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Or perhaps,&rsquo; the sergeant pursued, vexedly, &lsquo;we shall be obliged to\n      shoot him down as he dashes out when the door is opened.&rsquo; He was going to\n      give further vent to his anxieties as to the proper carrying out of the\n      sentence; but he interrupted himself with a sudden exclamation, snatched a\n      musket from a soldier, and stood watchful with his eyes fixed on the\n      window.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      IV\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Gaspar Ruiz had clambered up on the sill, and sat down there with his\n      feet against the thickness of the wall and his knees slightly bent. The\n      window was not quite broad enough for the length of his legs. It appeared\n      to my crestfallen perception that he meant to keep the window all to\n      himself. He seemed to be taking up a comfortable position. Nobody inside\n      dared to approach him now he could strike with his hands.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Por Dios!&rsquo; I heard the sergeant muttering at my elbow, &lsquo;I shall shoot\n      him through the head now, and get rid of that trouble. He is a condemned\n      man.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;At that I looked at him angrily. &lsquo;The general has not confirmed the\n      sentence,&rsquo; I said&mdash;though I knew well in my heart that these were but\n      vain words. The sentence required no confirmation. &lsquo;You have no right to\n      shoot him unless he tries to escape,&rsquo; I added, firmly.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;But sangre de Dios!&rsquo; the sergeant yelled out, bringing his musket up to\n      the shoulder, &lsquo;he is escaping now. Look!&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;But I, as if that Gaspar Ruiz had cast a spell upon me, struck the musket\n      upward, and the bullet flew over the roofs somewhere. The sergeant dashed\n      his arm to the ground and stared. He might have commanded the soldiers to\n      fire, but he did not. And if he had he would not have been obeyed, I\n      think, just then.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;With his feet against the thickness of the wall and his hairy hands\n      grasping the iron bar, Gaspar sat still. It was an attitude. Nothing\n      happened for a time. And suddenly it dawned upon us that he was\n      straightening his bowed back and contracting his arms. His lips were\n      twisted into a snarl. Next thing we perceived was that the bar of forged\n      iron was being bent slowly by the mightiness of his pull. The sun was\n      beating full upon his cramped, unquivering figure. A shower of sweat-drops\n      burst out of his forehead. Watching the bar grow crooked, I saw a little\n      blood ooze from under his finger-nails. Then he let go. For a moment he\n      remained all huddled up, with a hanging head, looking drowsily into the\n      upturned palms of his mighty hands. Indeed he seemed to have dozed off.\n      Suddenly he flung himself backwards on the sill, and setting the soles of\n      his bare feet against the other middle bar, he bent that one, too, but in\n      the opposite direction from the first.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Such was his strength, which in this case relieved my painful feelings.\n      And the man seemed to have done nothing. Except for the change of position\n      in order to use his feet, which made us all start by its swiftness, my\n      recollection is that of immobility. But he had bent the bars wide apart.\n      And now he could get out if he liked; but he dropped his legs inwards, and\n      looking over his shoulder beckoned to the soldiers. &lsquo;Hand up the water,&rsquo; \n      he said. &lsquo;I will give them all a drink.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He was obeyed. For a moment I expected man and bucket to disappear,\n      overwhelmed by the rush of eagerness; I thought they would pull him down\n      with their teeth. There was a rush, but holding the bucket on his lap he\n      repulsed the assault of those wretches by the mere swinging of his feet.\n      They flew backwards at every kick, yelling with pain; and the soldiers\n      laughed, gazing at the window.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;They all laughed, holding their sides, except the sergeant, who was\n      gloomy and morose. He was afraid the prisoners would rise and break out&mdash;which\n      would have been a bad example. But there was no fear of that, and I stood\n      myself before the window with my drawn sword. When sufficiently tamed by\n      the strength of Gaspar Ruiz they came up one by one, stretching their\n      necks and presenting their lips to the edge of the bucket which the strong\n      man tilted towards them from his knees with an extraordinary air of\n      charity, gentleness, and compassion. That benevolent appearance was of\n      course the effect of his care in not spilling the water and of his\n      attitude as he sat on the sill; for, if a man lingered with his lips glued\n      to the rim of the bucket after Gaspar Ruiz had said &lsquo;You have had enough,&rsquo; \n      there would be no tenderness or mercy in the shove of the foot which would\n      send him groaning and doubled up far into the interior of the prison,\n      where he would knock down two or three others before he fell himself. They\n      came up to him again and again; it looked as if they meant to drink the\n      well dry before going to their death; but the soldiers were so amused by\n      Gaspar Ruiz&rsquo;s systematic proceedings that they carried the water up to the\n      window cheerfully.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;When the adjutant came out after his siesta there was some trouble over\n      this affair, I can assure you. And the worst of it was that the general\n      whom we expected never came to the castle that day.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The guests of General Santierra unanimously expressed their regret that\n      the man of such strength and patience had not been saved.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He was not saved by my interference,&rdquo; said the General. &ldquo;The prisoners\n      were led to execution half an hour before sunset. Gaspar Ruiz, contrary to\n      the sergeant&rsquo;s apprehensions, gave no trouble. There was no necessity to\n      get a cavalry man with a lasso in order to subdue him, as if he were a\n      wild bull of the campo. I believe he marched out with his arms free\n      amongst the others who were bound. I did not see. I was not there. I had\n      been put under arrest for interfering with the prisoner&rsquo;s guard. About\n      dusk, sitting dismally in my quarters, I heard three volleys fired, and\n      thought that I should never hear of Gaspar Ruiz again. He fell with the\n      others. But we were to hear of him nevertheless, though the sergeant\n      boasted that as he lay on his face expiring or dead in the heap of the\n      slain, he had slashed his neck with a sword. He had done this, he said, to\n      make sure of ridding the world of a dangerous traitor.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I confess to you, senores, that I thought of that strong man with a sort\n      of gratitude, and with some admiration. He had used his strength\n      honourably. There dwelt, then, in his soul no fierceness corresponding to\n      the vigour of his body.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      V\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Gaspar Ruiz, who could with ease bend apart the heavy iron bars of the\n      prison, was led out with others to summary execution. &ldquo;Every bullet has\n      its billet,&rdquo; runs the proverb. All the merit of proverbs consists in the\n      concise and picturesque expression. In the surprise of our minds is found\n      their persuasiveness. In other words, we are struck and convinced by the\n      shock.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      What surprises us is the form, not the substance. Proverbs are art&mdash;cheap\n      art. As a general rule they are not true; unless indeed they happen to be\n      mere platitudes, as for instance the proverb, &ldquo;Half a loaf is better than\n      no bread,&rdquo; or &ldquo;A miss is as good as a mile.&rdquo; Some proverbs are simply\n      imbecile, others are immoral. That one evolved out of the naive heart of\n      the great Russian people, &ldquo;Man discharges the piece, but God carries the\n      bullet,&rdquo; is piously atrocious, and at bitter variance with the accepted\n      conception of a compassionate God. It would indeed be an inconsistent\n      occupation for the Guardian of the poor, the innocent, and the helpless,\n      to carry the bullet, for instance, into the heart of a father.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Gaspar Ruiz was childless, he had no wife, he had never been in love. He\n      had hardly ever spoken to a woman, beyond his mother and the ancient\n      negress of the household, whose wrinkled skin was the colour of cinders,\n      and whose lean body was bent double from age. If some bullets from those\n      muskets fired off at fifteen paces were specifically destined for the\n      heart of Gaspar Ruiz, they all missed their billet. One, however, carried\n      away a small piece of his ear, and another a fragment of flesh from his\n      shoulder.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      A red and unclouded sun setting into a purple ocean looked with a fiery\n      stare upon the enormous wall of the Cordilleras, worthy witnesses of his\n      glorious extinction. But it is inconceivable that it should have seen the\n      ant-like men busy with their absurd and insignificant trials of killing\n      and dying for reasons that, apart from being generally childish, were also\n      imperfectly understood. It did light up, however, the backs of the firing\n      party and the faces of the condemned men. Some of them had fallen on their\n      knees, others remained standing, a few averted their heads from the\n      levelled barrels of muskets. Gaspar Ruiz, upright, the burliest of them\n      all, hung his big shock head. The low sun dazzled him a little, and he\n      counted himself a dead man already.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He fell at the first discharge. He fell because he thought he was a dead\n      man. He struck the ground heavily. The jar of the fall surprised him. &ldquo;I\n      am not dead apparently,&rdquo; he thought to himself, when he heard the\n      execution platoon reloading its arms at the word of command. It was then\n      that the hope of escape dawned upon him for the first time. He remained\n      lying stretched out with rigid limbs under the weight of two bodies\n      collapsed crosswise upon his back.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      By the time the soldiers had fired a third volley into the slightly\n      stirring heaps of the slain, the sun had gone out of sight, and almost\n      immediately with the darkening of the ocean dusk fell upon the coasts of\n      the young Republic. Above the gloom of the lowlands the snowy peaks of the\n      Cordilleras remained luminous and crimson for a long time. The soldiers\n      before marching back to the fort sat down to smoke.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The sergeant with a naked sword in his hand strolled away by himself along\n      the heap of the dead. He was a humane man, and watched for any stir or\n      twitch of limb in the merciful idea of plunging the point of his blade\n      into any body giving the slightest sign of life. But none of the bodies\n      afforded him an opportunity for the display of this charitable intention.\n      Not a muscle twitched amongst them, not even the powerful muscles of\n      Gaspar Ruiz, who, deluged with the blood of his neighbours and shamming\n      death, strove to appear more lifeless than the others.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He was lying face down. The sergeant recognized him by his stature, and\n      being himself a very small man, looked with envy and contempt at the\n      prostration of so much strength. He had always disliked that particular\n      soldier. Moved by an obscure animosity, he inflicted a long gash across\n      the neck of Gaspar Ruiz, with some vague notion of making sure of that\n      strong man&rsquo;s death, as if a powerful physique were more able to resist the\n      bullets. For the sergeant had no doubt that Gaspar Ruiz had been shot\n      through in many places. Then he passed on, and shortly afterwards marched\n      off with his men, leaving the bodies to the care of crows and vultures.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Gaspar Ruiz had restrained a cry, though it had seemed to him that his\n      head was cut off at a blow; and when darkness came, shaking off the dead,\n      whose weight had oppressed him, he crawled away over the plain on his\n      hands and knees. After drinking deeply, like a wounded beast, at a shallow\n      stream, he assumed an upright posture, and staggered on light-headed and\n      aimless, as if lost amongst the stars of the clear night. A small house\n      seemed to rise out of the ground before him. He stumbled into the porch\n      and struck at the door with his fist. There was not a gleam of light.\n      Gaspar Ruiz might have thought that the inhabitants had fled from it, as\n      from many others in the neighbourhood, had it not been for the shouts of\n      abuse that answered his thumping. In his feverish and enfeebled state the\n      angry screaming seemed to him part of a hallucination belonging to the\n      weird, dreamlike feeling of his unexpected condemnation to death, of the\n      thirst suffered, of the volleys fired at him within fifteen paces, of his\n      head being cut off at a blow. &ldquo;Open the door!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Open in the name\n      of God!&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      An infuriated voice from within jeered at him: &ldquo;Come in, come in. This\n      house belongs to you. All this land belongs to you. Come and take it.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;For the love of God,&rdquo; Gaspar Ruiz murmured.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Does not all the land belong to you patriots?&rdquo; the voice on the other\n      side of the door screamed on. &ldquo;Are you not a patriot?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Gaspar Ruiz did not know. &ldquo;I am a wounded man,&rdquo; he said, apathetically.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      All became still inside. Gaspar Ruiz lost the hope of being admitted, and\n      lay down under the porch just outside the door. He was utterly careless of\n      what was going to happen to him. All his consciousness seemed to be\n      concentrated in his neck, where he felt a severe pain. His indifference as\n      to his fate was genuine. The day was breaking when he awoke from a\n      feverish doze; the door at which he had knocked in the dark stood wide\n      open now, and a girl, steadying herself with her outspread arms, leaned\n      over the threshold. Lying on his back, he stared up at her. Her face was\n      pale and her eyes were very dark; her hair hung down black as ebony\n      against her white cheeks; her lips were full and red. Beyond her he saw\n      another head with long grey hair, and a thin old face with a pair of\n      anxiously clasped hands under the chin.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      VI\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I knew those people by sight,&rdquo; General Santierra would tell his guests at\n      the dining-table. &ldquo;I mean the people with whom Gaspar Ruiz found shelter.\n      The father was an old Spaniard, a man of property ruined by the\n      revolution. His estates, his house in town, his money, everything he had\n      in the world had been confiscated by proclamation, for he was a bitter foe\n      of our independence. From a position of great dignity and influence on the\n      Viceroy&rsquo;s Council he became of less importance than his own negro slaves\n      made free by our glorious revolution. He had not even the means to flee\n      the country, as other Spaniards had managed to do. It may be that,\n      wandering ruined and houseless, and burdened with nothing but his life,\n      which was left to him by the clemency of the Provisional Government, he\n      had simply walked under that broken roof of old tiles. It was a lonely\n      spot. There did not seem to be even a dog belonging to the place. But\n      though the roof had holes, as if a cannon-ball or two had dropped through\n      it, the wooden shutters were thick and tight-closed all the time.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;My way took me frequently along the path in front of that miserable\n      rancho. I rode from the fort to the town almost every evening, to sigh at\n      the window of a lady I was in love with, then. When one is young, you\n      understand. . . . She was a good patriot, you may believe. Caballeros,\n      credit me or not, political feeling ran so high in those days that I do\n      not believe I could have been fascinated by the charms of a woman of\n      Royalist opinions. . . .&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Murmurs of amused incredulity all round the table interrupted the General;\n      and while they lasted he stroked his white beard gravely.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Senores,&rdquo; he protested, &ldquo;a Royalist was a monster to our overwrought\n      feelings. I am telling you this in order not to be suspected of the\n      slightest tenderness towards that old Royalist&rsquo;s daughter. Moreover, as\n      you know, my affections were engaged elsewhere. But I could not help\n      noticing her on rare occasions when with the front door open she stood in\n      the porch.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;You must know that this old Royalist was as crazy as a man can be. His\n      political misfortunes, his total downfall and ruin, had disordered his\n      mind. To show his contempt for what we patriots could do, he affected to\n      laugh at his imprisonment, at the confiscation of his lands, the burning\n      of his houses, and at the misery to which he and his womenfolk were\n      reduced. This habit of laughing had grown upon him, so that he would begin\n      to laugh and shout directly he caught sight of any stranger. That was the\n      form of his madness.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I, of course, disregarded the noise of that madman with that feeling of\n      superiority the success of our cause inspired in us Americans. I suppose I\n      really despised him because he was an old Castilian, a Spaniard born, and\n      a Royalist. Those were certainly no reasons to scorn a man; but for\n      centuries Spaniards born had shown their contempt of us Americans, men as\n      well descended as themselves, simply because we were what they called\n      colonists. We had been kept in abasement and made to feel our inferiority\n      in social intercourse. And now it was our turn. It was safe for us\n      patriots to display the same sentiments; and I being a young patriot, son\n      of a patriot, despised that old Spaniard, and despising him I naturally\n      disregarded his abuse, though it was annoying to my feelings. Others\n      perhaps would not have been so forbearing.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He would begin with a great yell&mdash;&lsquo;I see a patriot. Another of\n      them!&rsquo; long before I came abreast of the house. The tone of his senseless\n      revilings, mingled with bursts of laughter, was sometimes piercingly\n      shrill and sometimes grave. It was all very mad; but I felt it incumbent\n      upon my dignity to check my horse to a walk without even glancing towards\n      the house, as if that man&rsquo;s abusive clamour in the porch were less than\n      the barking of a cur. Always I rode by preserving an expression of haughty\n      indifference on my face.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It was no doubt very dignified; but I should have done better if I had\n      kept my eyes open. A military man in war time should never consider\n      himself off duty; and especially so if the war is a revolutionary war,\n      when the enemy is not at the door, but within your very house. At such\n      times the heat of passionate convictions passing into hatred, removes the\n      restraints of honour and humanity from many men and of delicacy and fear\n      from some women. These last, when once they throw off the timidity and\n      reserve of their sex, become by the vivacity of their intelligence and the\n      violence of their merciless resentment more dangerous than so many armed\n      giants.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The General&rsquo;s voice rose, but his big hand stroked his white beard twice\n      with an effect of venerable calmness. &ldquo;Si, Senores! Women are ready to\n      rise to the heights of devotion unattainable by us men, or to sink into\n      the depths of abasement which amazes our masculine prejudices. I am\n      speaking now of exceptional women, you understand. . . .&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Here one of the guests observed that he had never met a woman yet who was\n      not capable of turning out quite exceptional under circumstances that\n      would engage her feelings strongly. &ldquo;That sort of superiority in\n      recklessness they have over us,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;makes of them the more\n      interesting half of mankind.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The General, who bore the interruption with gravity, nodded courteous\n      assent. &ldquo;Si. Si. Under circumstances. . . . Precisely. They can do an\n      infinite deal of mischief sometimes in quite unexpected ways. For who\n      could have imagined that a young girl, daughter of a ruined Royalist whose\n      life was held only by the contempt of his enemies, would have had the\n      power to bring death and devastation upon two flourishing provinces and\n      cause serious anxiety to the leaders of the revolution in the very hour of\n      its success!&rdquo; He paused to let the wonder of it penetrate our minds.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Death and devastation,&rdquo; somebody murmured in surprise: &ldquo;how shocking!&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The old General gave a glance in the direction of the murmur and went on.\n      &ldquo;Yes. That is, war&mdash;calamity. But the means by which she obtained the\n      power to work this havoc on our southern frontier seem to me, who have\n      seen her and spoken to her, still more shocking. That particular thing\n      left on my mind a dreadful amazement which the further experience of life,\n      of more than fifty years, has done nothing to diminish.&rdquo; He looked round\n      as if to make sure of our attention, and, in a changed voice: &ldquo;I am, as\n      you know, a republican, son of a Liberator,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;My incomparable\n      mother, God rest her soul, was a Frenchwoman, the daughter of an ardent\n      republican. As a boy I fought for liberty; I&rsquo;ve always believed in the\n      equality of men; and as to their brotherhood, that, to my mind, is even\n      more certain. Look at the fierce animosity they display in their\n      differences. And what in the world do you know that is more bitterly\n      fierce than brothers&rsquo; quarrels?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      All absence of cynicism checked an inclination to smile at this view of\n      human brotherhood. On the contrary, there was in the tone the melancholy\n      natural to a man profoundly humane at heart who from duty, from\n      conviction, and from necessity, had played his part in scenes of ruthless\n      violence.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The General had seen much of fratricidal strife. &ldquo;Certainly. There is no\n      doubt of their brotherhood,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;All men are brothers, and as\n      such know almost too much of each other. But&rdquo;&mdash;and here in the old\n      patriarchal head, white as silver, the black eyes humorously twinkled&mdash;&ldquo;if\n      we are all brothers, all the women are not our sisters.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      One of the younger guests was heard murmuring his satisfaction at the\n      fact. But the General continued, with deliberate earnestness: &ldquo;They are so\n      different! The tale of a king who took a beggar-maid for a partner of his\n      throne may be pretty enough as we men look upon ourselves and upon love.\n      But that a young girl, famous for her haughty beauty and, only a short\n      time before, the admired of all at the balls in the Viceroy&rsquo;s palace,\n      should take by the hand a guasso, a common peasant, is intolerable to our\n      sentiment of women and their love. It is madness. Nevertheless it\n      happened. But it must be said that in her case it was the madness of hate&mdash;not\n      of love.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      After presenting this excuse in a spirit of chivalrous justice, the\n      General remained silent for a time. &ldquo;I rode past the house every day\n      almost,&rdquo; he began again, &ldquo;and this was what was going on within. But how\n      it was going on no mind of man can conceive. Her desperation must have\n      been extreme, and Gaspar Ruiz was a docile fellow. He had been an obedient\n      soldier. His strength was like an enormous stone lying on the ground,\n      ready to be hurled this way or that by the hand that picks it up.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It is clear that he would tell his story to the people who gave him the\n      shelter he needed. And he needed assistance badly. His wound was not\n      dangerous, but his life was forfeited. The old Royalist being wrapped up\n      in his laughing madness, the two women arranged a hiding-place for the\n      wounded man in one of the huts amongst the fruit trees at the back of the\n      house. That hovel, an abundance of clear water while the fever was on him,\n      and some words of pity were all they could give. I suppose he had a share\n      of what food there was. And it would be but little: a handful of roasted\n      corn, perhaps a dish of beans, or a piece of bread with a few figs. To\n      such misery were those proud and once wealthy people reduced.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      VII\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      General Santierra was right in his surmise. Such was the exact nature of\n      the assistance which Gaspar Ruiz, peasant son of peasants, received from\n      the Royalist family whose daughter had opened the door of their miserable\n      refuge to his extreme distress. Her sombre resolution ruled the madness of\n      her father and the trembling bewilderment of her mother.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      She had asked the strange man on the doorstep, &ldquo;Who wounded you?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The soldiers, senora,&rdquo; Gaspar Ruiz had answered, in a faint voice.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Patriots?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Si.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Deserter,&rdquo; he gasped, leaning against the wall under the scrutiny of her\n      black eyes. &ldquo;I was left for dead over there.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      She led him through the house out to a small hut of clay and reeds, lost\n      in the long grass of the overgrown orchard. He sank on a heap of maize\n      straw in a corner, and sighed profoundly.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;No one will look for you here,&rdquo; she said, looking down at him. &ldquo;Nobody\n      comes near us. We, too, have been left for dead&mdash;here.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      He stirred uneasily on his heap of dirty straw, and the pain in his neck\n      made him groan deliriously.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I shall show Estaban some day that I am alive yet,&rdquo; he mumbled.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He accepted her assistance in silence, and the many days of pain went by.\n      Her appearances in the hut brought him relief and became connected with\n      the feverish dreams of angels which visited his couch; for Gaspar Ruiz was\n      instructed in the mysteries of his religion, and had even been taught to\n      read and write a little by the priest of his village. He waited for her\n      with impatience, and saw her pass out of the dark hut and disappear in the\n      brilliant sunshine with poignant regret. He discovered that, while he lay\n      there feeling so very weak, he could, by closing his eyes, evoke her face\n      with considerable distinctness. And this discovered faculty charmed the\n      long, solitary hours of his convalescence. Later on, when he began to\n      regain his strength, he would creep at dusk from his hut to the house and\n      sit on the step of the garden door.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In one of the rooms the mad father paced to and fro, muttering to himself\n      with short, abrupt laughs. In the passage, sitting on a stool, the mother\n      sighed and moaned. The daughter, in rough threadbare clothing, and her\n      white haggard face half hidden by a coarse manta, stood leaning against\n      the side of the door. Gaspar Ruiz, with his elbows propped on his knees\n      and his head resting in his hands, talked to the two women in an\n      undertone.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The common misery of destitution would have made a bitter mockery of a\n      marked insistence on social differences. Gaspar Ruiz understood this in\n      his simplicity. From his captivity amongst the Royalists he could give\n      them news of people they knew. He described their appearance; and when he\n      related the story of the battle in which he was recaptured the two women\n      lamented the blow to their cause and the ruin of their secret hopes.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He had no feeling either way. But he felt a great devotion for that young\n      girl. In his desire to appear worthy of her condescension, he boasted a\n      little of his bodily strength. He had nothing else to boast of. Because of\n      that quality his comrades treated him with as great a deference, he\n      explained, as though he had been a sergeant, both in camp and in battle.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I could always get as many as I wanted to follow me anywhere, senorita. I\n      ought to have been made an officer, because I can read and write.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Behind him the silent old lady fetched a moaning sigh from time to time;\n      the distracted father muttered to himself, pacing the sala; and Gaspar\n      Ruiz would raise his eyes now and then to look at the daughter of these\n      people.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He would look at her with curiosity because she was alive, and also with\n      that feeling of familiarity and awe with which he had contemplated in\n      churches the inanimate and powerful statues of the saints, whose\n      protection is invoked in dangers and difficulties. His difficulty was very\n      great.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He could not remain hiding in an orchard for ever and ever. He knew also\n      very well that before he had gone half a day&rsquo;s journey in any direction,\n      he would be picked up by one of the cavalry patrols scouring the country,\n      and brought into one or another of the camps where the patriot army\n      destined for the liberation of Peru was collected. There he would in the\n      end be recognized as Gaspar Ruiz&mdash;the deserter to the Royalists&mdash;and\n      no doubt shot very effectually this time. There did not seem any place in\n      the world for the innocent Gaspar Ruiz anywhere. And at this thought his\n      simple soul surrendered itself to gloom and resentment as black as night.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      They had made him a soldier forcibly. He did not mind being a soldier. And\n      he had been a good soldier as he had been a good son, because of his\n      docility and his strength. But now there was no use for either. They had\n      taken him from his parents, and he could no longer be a soldier&mdash;not\n      a good soldier at any rate. Nobody would listen to his explanations. What\n      injustice it was! What injustice!\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      And in a mournful murmur he would go over the story of his capture and\n      recapture for the twentieth time. Then, raising his eyes to the silent\n      girl in the doorway, &ldquo;Si, senorita,&rdquo; he would say with a deep sigh,\n      &ldquo;injustice has made this poor breath in my body quite worthless to me and\n      to anybody else. And I do not care who robs me of it.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      One evening, as he exhaled thus the plaint of his wounded soul, she\n      condescended to say that, if she were a man, she would consider no life\n      worthless which held the possibility of revenge.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      She seemed to be speaking to herself. Her voice was low. He drank in the\n      gentle, as if dreamy sound with a consciousness of peculiar delight of\n      something warming his breast like a draught of generous wine.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;True, Senorita,&rdquo; he said, raising his face up to hers slowly: &ldquo;there is\n      Estaban, who must be shown that I am not dead after all.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The mutterings of the mad father had ceased long before; the sighing\n      mother had withdrawn somewhere into one of the empty rooms. All was still\n      within as well as without, in the moonlight bright as day on the wild\n      orchard full of inky shadows. Gaspar Ruiz saw the dark eyes of Dona\n      Erminia look down at him.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Ah! The sergeant,&rdquo; she muttered, disdainfully.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Why! He has wounded me with his sword,&rdquo; he protested, bewildered by the\n      contempt that seemed to shine livid on her pale face.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      She crushed him with her glance. The power of her will to be understood\n      was so strong that it kindled in him the intelligence of unexpressed\n      things.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;What else did you expect me to do?&rdquo; he cried, as if suddenly driven to\n      despair. &ldquo;Have I the power to do more? Am I a general with an army at my\n      back?&mdash;miserable sinner that I am to be despised by you at last.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      VIII\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Senores,&rdquo; related the General to his guests, &ldquo;though my thoughts were of\n      love then, and therefore enchanting, the sight of that house always\n      affected me disagreeably, especially in the moonlight, when its close\n      shutters and its air of lonely neglect appeared sinister. Still I went on\n      using the bridle-path by the ravine, because it was a short cut. The mad\n      Royalist howled and laughed at me every evening to his complete\n      satisfaction; but after a time, as if wearied with my indifference, he\n      ceased to appear in the porch. How they persuaded him to leave off I do\n      not know. However, with Gaspar Ruiz in the house there would have been no\n      difficulty in restraining him by force. It was now part of their policy in\n      there to avoid anything which could provoke me. At least, so I suppose.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Notwithstanding my infatuation with the brightest pair of eyes in Chile,\n      I noticed the absence of the old man after a week or so. A few more days\n      passed. I began to think that perhaps these Royalists had gone away\n      somewhere else. But one evening, as I was hastening towards the city, I\n      saw again somebody in the porch. It was not the madman; it was the girl.\n      She stood holding on to one of the wooden columns, tall and white-faced,\n      her big eyes sunk deep with privation and sorrow. I looked hard at her,\n      and she met my stare with a strange, inquisitive look. Then, as I turned\n      my head after riding past, she seemed to gather courage for the act, and\n      absolutely beckoned me back.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I obeyed, senores, almost without thinking, so great was my astonishment.\n      It was greater still when I heard what she had to say. She began by\n      thanking me for my forbearance of her father&rsquo;s infirmity, so that I felt\n      ashamed of myself. I had meant to show disdain, not forbearance! Every\n      word must have burnt her lips, but she never departed from a gentle and\n      melancholy dignity which filled me with respect against my will. Senores,\n      we are no match for women. But I could hardly believe my ears when she\n      began her tale. Providence, she concluded, seemed to have preserved the\n      life of that wronged soldier, who now trusted to my honour as a caballero\n      and to my compassion for his sufferings.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Wronged man,&rsquo; I observed, coldly. &lsquo;Well, I think so, too: and you have\n      been harbouring an enemy of your cause.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;He was a poor Christian crying for help at our door in the name of God,\n      senor,&rsquo; she answered, simply.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I began to admire her. &lsquo;Where is he now?&rsquo; I asked, stiffly.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;But she would not answer that question. With extreme cunning, and an\n      almost fiendish delicacy, she managed to remind me of my failure in saving\n      the lives of the prisoners in the guardroom, without wounding my pride.\n      She knew, of course, the whole story. Gaspar Ruiz, she said, entreated me\n      to procure for him a safe-conduct from General San Martin himself. He had\n      an important communication to make to the commander-in-chief.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Por Dios, senores, she made me swallow all that, pretending to be only\n      the mouthpiece of that poor man. Overcome by injustice, he expected to\n      find, she said, as much generosity in me as had been shown to him by the\n      Royalist family which had given him a refuge.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Ha! It was well and nobly said to a youngster like me. I thought her\n      great. Alas! she was only implacable.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;In the end I rode away very enthusiastic about the business, without\n      demanding even to see Gaspar Ruiz, who I was confident was in the house.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;But on calm reflection I began to see some difficulties which I had not\n      confidence enough in myself to encounter. It was not easy to approach a\n      commander-in-chief with such a story. I feared failure. At last I thought\n      it better to lay the matter before my general-of-division, Robles, a\n      friend of my family, who had appointed me his aide-de-camp lately.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He took it out of my hands at once without any ceremony.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;In the house! of course he is in the house,&rsquo; he said contemptuously.\n      &lsquo;You ought to have gone sword in hand inside and demanded his surrender,\n      instead of chatting with a Royalist girl in the porch. Those people should\n      have been hunted out of that long ago. Who knows how many spies they have\n      harboured right in the very midst of our camps? A safe-conduct from the\n      Commander-in-Chief! The audacity of the fellow! Ha! ha! Now we shall catch\n      him to-night, and then we shall find out, without any safe-conduct, what\n      he has got to say, that is so very important. Ha! ha! ha!&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;General Robles, peace to his soul, was a short, thick man, with round,\n      staring eyes, fierce and jovial. Seeing my distress he added:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Come, come, chico. I promise you his life if he does not resist. And\n      that is not likely. We are not going to break up a good soldier if it can\n      be helped. I tell you what! I am curious to see your strong man. Nothing\n      but a general will do for the picaro&mdash;well, he shall have a general\n      to talk to. Ha! ha! I shall go myself to the catching, and you are coming\n      with me, of course.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;And it was done that same night. Early in the evening the house and the\n      orchard were surrounded quietly. Later on the General and I left a ball we\n      were attending in town and rode out at an easy gallop. At some little\n      distance from the house we pulled up. A mounted orderly held our horses. A\n      low whistle warned the men watching all along the ravine, and we walked up\n      to the porch softly. The barricaded house in the moonlight seemed empty.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The General knocked at the door. After a time a woman&rsquo;s voice within\n      asked who was there. My chief nudged me hard. I gasped.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;It is I, Lieutenant Santierra,&rsquo; I stammered out, as if choked. &lsquo;Open the\n      door.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It came open slowly. The girl, holding a thin taper in her hand, seeing\n      another man with me, began to back away before us slowly, shading the\n      light with her hand. Her impassive white face looked ghostly. I followed\n      behind General Robles. Her eyes were fixed on mine. I made a gesture of\n      helplessness behind my chief&rsquo;s back, trying at the same time to give a\n      reassuring expression to my face. None of us three uttered a sound.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;We found ourselves in a room with bare floor and walls. There was a rough\n      table and a couple of stools in it, nothing else whatever. An old woman\n      with her grey hair hanging loose wrung her hands when we appeared. A peal\n      of loud laughter resounded through the empty house, very amazing and\n      weird. At this the old woman tried to get past us.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nobody to leave the room,&rsquo; said General Robles to me.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I swung the door to, heard the latch click, and the laughter became faint\n      in our ears.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Before another word could be spoken in that room I was amazed by hearing\n      the sound of distant thunder.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I had carried in with me into the house a vivid impression of a beautiful\n      clear moonlight night, without a speck of cloud in the sky. I could not\n      believe my ears. Sent early abroad for my education, I was not familiar\n      with the most dreaded natural phenomenon of my native land. I saw, with\n      inexpressible astonishment, a look of terror in my chief&rsquo;s eyes. Suddenly\n      I felt giddy. The General staggered against me heavily; the girl seemed to\n      reel in the middle of the room, the taper fell out of her hand and the\n      light went out; a shrill cry of &lsquo;Misericordia!&rsquo; from the old woman pierced\n      my ears. In the pitchy darkness I heard the plaster off the walls falling\n      on the floor. It is a mercy there was no ceiling. Holding on to the latch\n      of the door, I heard the grinding of the roof-tiles cease above my head.\n      The shock was over.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Out of the house! The door! Fly, Santierra, fly!&rsquo; howled the General.\n      You know, senores, in our country the bravest are not ashamed of the fear\n      an earthquake strikes into all the senses of man. One never gets used to\n      it. Repeated experience only augments the mastery of that nameless terror.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It was my first earthquake, and I was the calmest of them all. I\n      understood that the crash outside was caused by the porch, with its wooden\n      pillars and tiled roof projection, falling down. The next shock would\n      destroy the house, maybe. That rumble as of thunder was approaching again.\n      The General was rushing round the room, to find the door perhaps. He made\n      a noise as though he were trying to climb the walls, and I heard him\n      distinctly invoke the names of several saints. &lsquo;Out, out, Santierra!&rsquo; he\n      yelled.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The girl&rsquo;s voice was the only one I did not hear.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;General,&rsquo; I cried, I cannot move the door. We must be locked in.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I did not recognize his voice in the shout of malediction and despair he\n      let out. Senores, I know many men in my country, especially in the\n      provinces most subject to earthquakes, who will neither eat, sleep, pray,\n      nor even sit down to cards with closed doors. The danger is not in the\n      loss of time, but in this&mdash;that the movement of the walls may prevent\n      a door being opened at all. This was what had happened to us. We were\n      trapped, and we had no help to expect from anybody. There is no man in my\n      country who will go into a house when the earth trembles. There never was&mdash;except\n      one: Gaspar Ruiz.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He had come out of whatever hole he had been hiding in outside, and had\n      clambered over the timbers of the destroyed porch. Above the awful\n      subterranean groan of coming destruction I heard a mighty voice shouting\n      the word &lsquo;Erminia!&rsquo; with the lungs of a giant. An earthquake is a great\n      leveller of distinctions. I collected all my resolution against the terror\n      of the scene. &lsquo;She is here,&rsquo; I shouted back. A roar as of a furious wild\n      beast answered me&mdash;while my head swam, my heart sank, and the sweat\n      of anguish streamed like rain off my brow.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He had the strength to pick up one of the heavy posts of the porch.\n      Holding it under his armpit like a lance, but with both hands, he charged\n      madly the rocking house with the force of a battering-ram, bursting open\n      the door and rushing in, headlong, over our prostrate bodies. I and the\n      General picking ourselves up, bolted out together, without looking round\n      once till we got across the road. Then, clinging to each other, we beheld\n      the house change suddenly into a heap of formless rubbish behind the back\n      of a man, who staggered towards us bearing the form of a woman clasped in\n      his arms. Her long black hair hung nearly to his feet. He laid her down\n      reverently on the heaving earth, and the moonlight shone on her closed\n      eyes.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Senores, we mounted with difficulty. Our horses getting up plunged madly,\n      held by the soldiers who had come running from all sides. Nobody thought\n      of catching Gaspar Ruiz then. The eyes of men and animals shone with wild\n      fear. My general approached Gaspar Ruiz, who stood motionless as a statue\n      above the girl. He let himself be shaken by the shoulder without detaching\n      his eyes from her face.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Que guape!&rsquo; shouted the General in his ear. &lsquo;You are the bravest man\n      living. You have saved my life. I am General Robles. Come to my quarters\n      to-morrow if God gives us the grace to see another day.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He never stirred&mdash;as if deaf, without feeling, insensible.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;We rode away for the town, full of our relations, of our friends, of\n      whose fate we hardly dared to think. The soldiers ran by the side of our\n      horses. Everything was forgotten in the immensity of the catastrophe\n      overtaking a whole country.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      . . . . . . .\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Gaspar Ruiz saw the girl open her eyes. The raising of her eyelids seemed\n      to recall him from a trance. They were alone; the cries of terror and\n      distress from homeless people filled the plains of the coast remote and\n      immense, coming like a whisper into their loneliness.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      She rose swiftly to her feet, darting fearful glances on all sides. &ldquo;What\n      is it?&rdquo; she cried out low, and peering into his face. &ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      He bowed his head sadly, without a word.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;. . . Who are you?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      He knelt down slowly before her, and touched the hem of her coarse black\n      baize skirt. &ldquo;Your slave,&rdquo; he said.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      She caught sight then of the heap of rubbish that had been the house, all\n      misty in the cloud of dust. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she cried, pressing her hand to her\n      forehead.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I carried you out from there,&rdquo; he whispered at her feet.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;And they?&rdquo; she asked in a great sob.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He rose, and taking her by the arms, led her gently towards the shapeless\n      ruin half overwhelmed by a landslide. &ldquo;Come and listen,&rdquo; he said.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The serene moon saw them clambering over that heap of stones, joists and\n      tiles, which was a grave. They pressed their ears to the interstices,\n      listening for the sound of a groan, for a sigh of pain.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      At last he said, &ldquo;They died swiftly. You are alone.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      She sat down on a piece of broken timber and put one arm across her face.\n      He waited&mdash;then approaching his lips to her ear: &ldquo;Let us go,&rdquo; he\n      whispered.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Never&mdash;never from here,&rdquo; she cried out, flinging her arms above her\n      head.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He stooped over her, and her raised arms fell upon his shoulders. He\n      lifted her up, steadied himself and began to walk, looking straight before\n      him.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; she asked, feebly.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I am escaping from my enemies,&rdquo; he said, never once glancing at his light\n      burden.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;With me?&rdquo; she sighed, helplessly.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Never without you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are my strength.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      He pressed her close to him. His face was grave and his footsteps steady.\n      The conflagrations bursting out in the ruins of destroyed villages dotted\n      the plain with red fires; and the sounds of distant lamentations, the\n      cries of Misericordia! Misericordia! made a desolate murmur in his ears.\n      He walked on, solemn and collected, as if carrying something holy,\n      fragile, and precious.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The earth rocked at times under his feet.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      IX\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      With movements of mechanical care and an air of abstraction old General\n      Santierra lighted a long and thick cigar.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It was a good many hours before we could send a party back to the\n      ravine,&rdquo; he said to his guests. &ldquo;We had found one-third of the town laid\n      low, the rest shaken up; and the inhabitants, rich and poor, reduced to\n      the same state of distraction by the universal disaster. The affected\n      cheerfulness of some contrasted with the despair of others. In the general\n      confusion a number of reckless thieves, without fear of God or man, became\n      a danger to those who from the downfall of their homes had managed to save\n      some valuables. Crying &lsquo;Misericordia&rsquo; louder than any at every tremor, and\n      beating their breast with one hand, these scoundrels robbed the poor\n      victims with the other, not even stopping short of murder.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;General Robles&rsquo; division was occupied entirely in guarding the destroyed\n      quarters of the town from the depredations of these inhuman monsters.\n      Taken up with my duties of orderly officer, it was only in the morning\n      that I could assure myself of the safety of my own family. My mother and\n      my sisters had escaped with their lives from that ballroom, where I had\n      left them early in the evening. I remember those two beautiful young women&mdash;God\n      rest their souls&mdash;as if I saw them this moment, in the garden of our\n      destroyed house, pale but active, assisting some of our poor neighbours,\n      in their soiled ball-dresses and with the dust of fallen walls on their\n      hair. As to my mother, she had a stoical soul in her frail body.\n      Half-covered by a costly shawl, she was lying on a rustic seat by the side\n      of an ornamental basin whose fountain had ceased to play for ever on that\n      night.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I had hardly had time to embrace them all with transports of joy when my\n      chief, coming along, dispatched me to the ravine with a few soldiers, to\n      bring in my strong man, as he called him, and that pale girl.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;But there was no one for us to bring in. A landslide had covered the\n      ruins of the house; and it was like a large mound of earth with only the\n      ends of some timbers visible here and there&mdash;nothing more.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Thus were the tribulations of the old Royalist couple ended. An enormous\n      and unconsecrated grave had swallowed them up alive, in their unhappy\n      obstinacy against the will of a people to be free. And their daughter was\n      gone.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;That Gaspar Ruiz had carried her off I understood very well. But as the\n      case was not foreseen, I had no instructions to pursue them. And certainly\n      I had no desire to do so. I had grown mistrustful of my interference. It\n      had never been successful, and had not even appeared creditable. He was\n      gone. Well, let him go. And he had carried off the Royalist girl! Nothing\n      better. Vaya con Dios. This was not the time to bother about a deserter\n      who, justly or unjustly, ought to have been dead, and a girl for whom it\n      would have been better to have never been born.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;So I marched my men back to the town.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;After a few days, order having been re-established, all the principal\n      families, including my own, left for Santiago. We had a fine house there.\n      At the same time the division of Robles was moved to new cantonments near\n      the capital. This change suited very well the state of my domestic and\n      amorous feelings.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;One night, rather late, I was called to my chief. I found General Robles\n      in his quarters, at ease, with his uniform off, drinking neat brandy out\n      of a tumbler&mdash;as a precaution, he used to say, against the\n      sleeplessness induced by the bites of mosquitoes. He was a good soldier,\n      and he taught me the art and practice of war. No doubt God has been\n      merciful to his soul; for his motives were never other than patriotic, if\n      his character was irascible. As to the use of mosquito nets, he considered\n      it effeminate, shameful&mdash;unworthy of a soldier. I noticed at the\n      first glance that his face, already very red, wore an expression of high\n      good-humour.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Aha! Senor teniente,&rsquo; he cried, loudly, as I saluted at the door.\n      &lsquo;Behold! Your strong man has turned up again.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He extended to me a folded letter, which I saw was superscribed &lsquo;To the\n      Commander-in-Chief of the Republican Armies.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;This,&rsquo; General Robles went on in his loud voice, &lsquo;was thrust by a boy\n      into the hand of a sentry at the Quartel General, while the fellow stood\n      there thinking of his girl, no doubt&mdash;for before he could gather his\n      wits together the boy had disappeared amongst the market people, and he\n      protests he could not recognize him to save his life.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;My chief told me further that the soldier had given the letter to the\n      sergeant of the guard, and that ultimately it had reached the hands of our\n      generalissimo. His Excellency had deigned to take cognizance of it with\n      his own eyes. After that he had referred the matter in confidence to\n      General Robles.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The letter, senores, I cannot now recollect textually. I saw the\n      signature of Gaspar Ruiz. He was an audacious fellow. He had snatched a\n      soul for himself out of a cataclysm, remember. And now it was that soul\n      which had dictated the terms of his letter. Its tone was very independent.\n      I remember it struck me at the time as noble&mdash;dignified. It was, no\n      doubt, her letter. Now I shudder at the depth of its duplicity. Gaspar\n      Ruiz was made to complain of the injustice of which he had been a victim.\n      He invoked his previous record of fidelity and courage. Having been saved\n      from death by the miraculous interposition of Providence, he could think\n      of nothing but of retrieving his character. This, he wrote, he could not\n      hope to do in the ranks as a discredited soldier still under suspicion. He\n      had the means to give a striking proof of his fidelity. He had ended by\n      proposing to the General-in-Chief a meeting at midnight in the middle of\n      the Plaza before the Moneta. The signal would be to strike fire with flint\n      and steel three times, which was not too conspicuous and yet distinctive\n      enough for recognition.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;San Martin, the great Liberator, loved men of audacity and courage.\n      Besides, he was just and compassionate. I told him as much of the man&rsquo;s\n      story as I knew, and was ordered to accompany him on the appointed night.\n      The signals were duly exchanged. It was midnight, and the whole town was\n      dark and silent. Their two cloaked figures came together in the centre of\n      the vast Plaza, and, keeping discreetly at a distance, I listened for an\n      hour or more to the murmur of their voices. Then the General motioned me\n      to approach; and as I did so I heard San Martin, who was courteous to\n      gentle and simple alike, offer Gaspar Ruiz the hospitality of the\n      headquarters for the night. But the soldier refused, saying that he would\n      be not worthy of that honour till he had done something.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;You cannot have a common deserter for your guest, Excellency,&rsquo; he\n      protested with a low laugh, and stepping backwards merged slowly into the\n      night.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The Commander-in-Chief observed to me, as we turned away: &lsquo;He had\n      somebody with him, our friend Ruiz. I saw two figures for a moment. It was\n      an unobtrusive companion.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I, too, had observed another figure join the vanishing form of Gaspar\n      Ruiz. It had the appearance of a short fellow in a poncho and a big hat.\n      And I wondered stupidly who it could be he had dared take into his\n      confidence. I might have guessed it could be no one but that fatal girl&mdash;alas!\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Where he kept her concealed I do not know. He had&mdash;it was known\n      afterwards&mdash;an uncle, his mother&rsquo;s brother, a small shopkeeper in\n      Santiago. Perhaps it was there that she found a roof and food. Whatever\n      she found, it was poor enough to exasperate her pride and keep up her\n      anger and hate. It is certain she did not accompany him on the feat he\n      undertook to accomplish first of all. It was nothing less than the\n      destruction of a store of war material collected secretly by the Spanish\n      authorities in the south, in a town called Linares. Gaspar Ruiz was\n      entrusted with a small party only, but they proved themselves worthy of\n      San Martin&rsquo;s confidence. The season was not propitious. They had to swim\n      swollen rivers. They seemed, however, to have galloped night and day\n      out-riding the news of their foray, and holding straight for the town, a\n      hundred miles into the enemy&rsquo;s country, till at break of day they rode\n      into it sword in hand, surprising the little garrison. It fled without\n      making a stand, leaving most of its officers in Gaspar Ruiz&rsquo; hands.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;A great explosion of gunpowder ended the conflagration of the magazines\n      the raiders had set on fire without loss of time. In less than six hours\n      they were riding away at the same mad speed, without the loss of a single\n      man. Good as they were, such an exploit is not performed without a still\n      better leadership.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I was dining at the headquarters when Gaspar Ruiz himself brought the\n      news of his success. And it was a great blow to the Royalist troops. For a\n      proof he displayed to us the garrison&rsquo;s flag. He took it from under his\n      poncho and flung it on the table. The man was transfigured; there was\n      something exulting and menacing in the expression of his face. He stood\n      behind General San Martin&rsquo;s chair and looked proudly at us all. He had a\n      round blue cap edged with silver braid on his head, and we all could see a\n      large white scar on the nape of his sunburnt neck.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Somebody asked him what he had done with the captured Spanish officers.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He shrugged his shoulders scornfully. &lsquo;What a question to ask! In a\n      partisan war you do not burden yourself with prisoners. I let them go&mdash;and\n      here are their sword-knots.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He flung a bunch of them on the table upon the flag. Then General Robles,\n      whom I was attending there, spoke up in his loud, thick voice: &lsquo;You did!\n      Then, my brave friend, you do not know yet how a war like ours ought to be\n      conducted. You should have done&mdash;this.&rsquo; And he passed the edge of his\n      hand across his own throat.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Alas, senores! It was only too true that on both sides this contest, in\n      its nature so heroic, was stained by ferocity. The murmurs that arose at\n      General Robles&rsquo; words were by no means unanimous in tone. But the generous\n      and brave San Martin praised the humane action, and pointed out to Ruiz a\n      place on his right hand. Then rising with a full glass he proposed a\n      toast: &lsquo;Caballeros and comrades-in-arms, let us drink the health of\n      Captain Gaspar Ruiz.&rsquo; And when we had emptied our glasses: &lsquo;I intend,&rsquo; the\n      Commander-in-Chief continued, &lsquo;to entrust him with the guardianship of our\n      southern frontier, while we go afar to liberate our brethren in Peru. He\n      whom the enemy could not stop from striking a blow at his very heart will\n      know how to protect the peaceful populations we leave behind us to pursue\n      our sacred task.&rsquo; And he embraced the silent Gaspar Ruiz by his side.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Later on, when we all rose from table, I approached the latest officer of\n      the army with my congratulations. &lsquo;And, Captain Ruiz,&rsquo; I added, &lsquo;perhaps\n      you do not mind telling a man who has always believed in the uprightness\n      of your character what became of Dona Erminia on that night?&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;At this friendly question his aspect changed. He looked at me from under\n      his eyebrows with the heavy, dull glance of a guasso&mdash;of a peasant.\n      &lsquo;Senor teniente,&rsquo; he said, thickly, and as if very much cast down, &lsquo;do not\n      ask me about the senorita, for I prefer not to think about her at all when\n      I am amongst you.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He looked, with a frown, all about the room, full of smoking and talking\n      officers. Of course I did not insist.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;These, senores, were the last words I was to hear him utter for a long,\n      long time. The very next day we embarked for our arduous expedition to\n      Peru, and we only heard of Gaspar Ruiz&rsquo; doings in the midst of battles of\n      our own. He had been appointed military guardian of our southern province.\n      He raised a partida. But his leniency to the conquered foe displeased the\n      Civil Governor, who was a formal, uneasy man, full of suspicions. He\n      forwarded reports against Gaspar Ruiz to the Supreme Government; one of\n      them being that he had married publicly, with great pomp, a woman of\n      Royalist tendencies. Quarrels were sure to arise between these two men of\n      very different character. At last the Civil Governor began to complain of\n      his inactivity and to hint at treachery, which, he wrote, would be not\n      surprising in a man of such antecedents. Gaspar Ruiz heard of it. His rage\n      flamed up, and the woman ever by his side knew how to feed it with\n      perfidious words. I do not know whether really the Supreme Government ever\n      did&mdash;as he complained afterwards&mdash;send orders for his arrest. It\n      seems certain that the Civil Governor began to tamper with his officers,\n      and that Gaspar Ruiz discovered the fact.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;One evening, when the Governor was giving a tertullia, Gaspar Ruiz,\n      followed by six men he could trust, appeared riding through the town to\n      the door of the Government House, and entered the sala armed, his hat on\n      his head. As the Governor, displeased, advanced to meet him, he seized the\n      wretched man round the body, carried him off from the midst of the\n      appalled guests, as though he were a child, and flung him down the outer\n      steps into the street. An angry hug from Gaspar Ruiz was enough to crush\n      the life out of a giant; but in addition Gaspar Ruiz&rsquo; horsemen fired their\n      pistols at the body of the Governor as it lay motionless at the bottom of\n      the stairs.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      X\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;After this&mdash;as he called it&mdash;act of justice, Ruiz crossed the\n      Rio Blanco, followed by the greater part of his band, and entrenched\n      himself upon a hill. A company of regular troops sent out foolishly\n      against him was surrounded, and destroyed almost to a man. Other\n      expeditions, though better organized, were equally unsuccessful.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It was during these sanguinary skirmishes that his wife first began to\n      appear on horseback at his right hand. Rendered proud and self-confident\n      by his successes, Ruiz no longer charged at the head of his partida, but\n      presumptuously, like a general directing the movements of an army, he\n      remained in the rear, well mounted and motionless on an eminence, sending\n      out his orders. She was seen repeatedly at his side, and for a long time\n      was mistaken for a man. There was much talk then of a mysterious\n      white-faced chief, to whom the defeats of our troops were ascribed. She\n      rode like an Indian woman, astride, wearing a broad-rimmed man&rsquo;s hat and a\n      dark poncho. Afterwards, in the day of their greatest prosperity, this\n      poncho was embroidered in gold, and she wore then, also, the sword of poor\n      Don Antonio de Leyva. This veteran Chilian officer, having the misfortune\n      to be surrounded with his small force, and running short of ammunition,\n      found his death at the hands of the Arauco Indians, the allies and\n      auxiliaries of Gaspar Ruiz. This was the fatal affair long remembered\n      afterwards as the &lsquo;Massacre of the Island.&rsquo; The sword of the unhappy\n      officer was presented to her by Peneleo, the Araucanian chief; for these\n      Indians, struck by her aspect, the deathly pallor of her face, which no\n      exposure to the weather seemed to affect, and her calm indifference under\n      fire, looked upon her as a supernatural being, or at least as a witch. By\n      this superstition the prestige and authority of Gaspar Ruiz amongst these\n      ignorant people were greatly augmented. She must have savoured her\n      vengeance to the full on that day when she buckled on the sword of Don\n      Antonio de Leyva. It never left her side, unless she put on her woman&rsquo;s\n      clothes&mdash;not that she would or could ever use it, but she loved to\n      feel it beating upon her thigh as a perpetual reminder and symbol of the\n      dishonour to the arms of the Republic. She was insatiable. Moreover, on\n      the path she had led Gaspar Ruiz upon, there is no stopping. Escaped\n      prisoners&mdash;and they were not many&mdash;used to relate how with a few\n      whispered words she could change the expression of his face and revive his\n      flagging animosity. They told how after every skirmish, after every raid,\n      after every successful action, he would ride up to her and look into her\n      face. Its haughty calm was never relaxed. Her embrace, senores, must have\n      been as cold as the embrace of a statue. He tried to melt her icy heart in\n      a stream of warm blood. Some English naval officers who visited him at\n      that time noticed the strange character of his infatuation.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      At the movement of surprise and curiosity in his audience General\n      Santierra paused for a moment.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;English naval officers,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Ruiz had consented to\n      receive them to arrange for the liberation of some prisoners of your\n      nationality. In the territory upon which he ranged, from sea coast to the\n      Cordillera, there was a bay where the ships of that time, after rounding\n      Cape Horn, used to resort for wood and water. There, decoying the crew on\n      shore, he captured first the whaling brig Hersalia, and afterwards made\n      himself master by surprise of two more ships, one English and one\n      American.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It was rumoured at the time that he dreamed of setting up a navy of his\n      own. But that, of course, was impossible. Still, manning the brig with\n      part of her own crew, and putting an officer and a good many men of his\n      own on board, he sent her off to the Spanish Governor of the island of\n      Chiloe with a report of his exploits, and a demand for assistance in the\n      war against the rebels. The Governor could not do much for him; but he\n      sent in return two light field-pieces, a letter of compliments, with a\n      colonel&rsquo;s commission in the royal forces, and a great Spanish flag. This\n      standard with much ceremony was hoisted over his house in the heart of the\n      Arauco country. Surely on that day she may have smiled on her guasso\n      husband with a less haughty reserve.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The senior officer of the English squadron on our coast made\n      representations to our Government as to these captures. But Gaspar Ruiz\n      refused to treat with us. Then an English frigate proceeded to the bay,\n      and her captain, doctor, and two lieutenants travelled inland under a\n      safe-conduct. They were well received, and spent three days as guests of\n      the partisan chief. A sort of military barbaric state was kept up at the\n      residence. It was furnished with the loot of frontier towns. When first\n      admitted to the principal sala, they saw his wife lying down (she was not\n      in good health then), with Gaspar Ruiz sitting at the foot of the couch.\n      His hat was lying on the floor, and his hands reposed on the hilt of his\n      sword.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;During that first conversation he never removed his big hands from the\n      sword-hilt, except once, to arrange the coverings about her, with gentle,\n      careful touches. They noticed that whenever she spoke he would fix his\n      eyes upon her in a kind of expectant, breathless attention, and seemingly\n      forget the existence of the world and his own existence, too. In the\n      course of the farewell banquet, at which she was present reclining on her\n      couch, he burst forth into complaints of the treatment he had received.\n      After General San Martin&rsquo;s departure he had been beset by spies, slandered\n      by civil officials, his services ignored, his liberty and even his life\n      threatened by the Chilian Government. He got up from the table, thundered\n      execrations pacing the room wildly, then sat down on the couch at his\n      wife&rsquo;s feet, his breast heaving, his eyes fixed on the floor. She reclined\n      on her back, her head on the cushions, her eyes nearly closed.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;And now I am an honoured Spanish officer,&rsquo; he added in a calm voice.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The captain of the English frigate then took the opportunity to inform\n      him gently that Lima had fallen, and that by the terms of a convention the\n      Spaniards were withdrawing from the whole continent.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Gaspar Ruiz raised his head, and without hesitation, speaking with\n      suppressed vehemence, declared that if not a single Spanish soldier were\n      left in the whole of South America he would persist in carrying on the\n      contest against Chile to the last drop of blood. When he finished that mad\n      tirade his wife&rsquo;s long white hand was raised, and she just caressed his\n      knee with the tips of her fingers for a fraction of a second.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;For the rest of the officers&rsquo; stay, which did not extend for more than\n      half an hour after the banquet, that ferocious chieftain of a desperate\n      partida overflowed with amiability and kindness. He had been hospitable\n      before, but now it seemed as though he could not do enough for the comfort\n      and safety of his visitors&rsquo; journey back to their ship.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Nothing, I have been told, could have presented a greater contrast to his\n      late violence or the habitual taciturn reserve of his manner. Like a man\n      elated beyond measure by an unexpected happiness, he overflowed with\n      good-will, amiability, and attentions. He embraced the officers like\n      brothers, almost with tears in his eyes. The released prisoners were\n      presented each with a piece of gold. At the last moment, suddenly, he\n      declared he could do no less than restore to the masters of the merchant\n      vessels all their private property. This unexpected generosity caused some\n      delay in the departure of the party, and their first march was very short.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Late in the evening Gaspar Ruiz rode up with an escort, to their camp\n      fires, bringing along with him a mule loaded with cases of wine. He had\n      come, he said, to drink a stirrup cup with his English friends, whom he\n      would never see again. He was mellow and joyous in his temper. He told\n      stories of his own exploits, laughed like a boy, borrowed a guitar from\n      the Englishmen&rsquo;s chief muleteer, and sitting cross-legged on his superfine\n      poncho spread before the glow of the embers, sang a guasso love-song in a\n      tender voice. Then his head dropped on his breast, his hands fell to the\n      ground; the guitar rolled off his knees&mdash;and a great hush fell over\n      the camp after the love-song of the implacable partisan who had made so\n      many of our people weep for destroyed homes and for loves cut short.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Before anybody could make a sound he sprang up from the ground and called\n      for his horse.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Adios, my friends!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;Go with God. I love you. And tell them\n      well in Santiago that between Gaspar Ruiz, colonel of the King of Spain,\n      and the republican carrion-crows of Chile there is war to the last breath&mdash;war!\n      war! war!&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;With a great yell of &lsquo;War! war! war!&rsquo; which his escort took up, they rode\n      away, and the sound of hoofs and of voices died out in the distance\n      between the slopes of the hills.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The two young English officers were convinced that Ruiz was mad. How do\n      you say that?&mdash;tile loose&mdash;eh? But the doctor, an observant\n      Scotsman with much shrewdness and philosophy in his character, told me\n      that it was a very curious case of possession. I met him many years\n      afterwards, but he remembered the experience very well. He told me, too,\n      that in his opinion that woman did not lead Gaspar Ruiz into the practice\n      of sanguinary treachery by direct persuasion, but by the subtle way of\n      awakening and keeping alive in his simple mind a burning sense of an\n      irreparable wrong. Maybe, maybe. But I would say that she poured half of\n      her vengeful soul into the strong clay of that man, as you may pour\n      intoxication, madness, poison into an empty cup.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;If he wanted war he got it in earnest when our victorious army began to\n      return from Peru. Systematic operations were planned against this blot on\n      the honour and prosperity of our hardly won independence. General Robles\n      commanded, with his well-known ruthless severity. Savage reprisals were\n      exercised on both sides and no quarter was given in the field. Having won\n      my promotion in the Peru campaign, I was a captain on the staff. Gaspar\n      Ruiz found himself hard pressed; at the same time we heard by means of a\n      fugitive priest who had been carried off from his village presbytery and\n      galloped eighty miles into the hills to perform the christening ceremony,\n      that a daughter was born to them. To celebrate the event, I suppose, Ruiz\n      executed one or two brilliant forays clear away at the rear of our forces,\n      and defeated the detachments sent out to cut off his retreat. General\n      Robles nearly had a stroke of apoplexy from rage. He found another cause\n      of insomnia than the bites of mosquitoes; but against this one, senores,\n      tumblers of raw brandy had no more effect than so much water. He took to\n      railing and storming at me about my strong man. And from our impatience to\n      end this inglorious campaign I am afraid that all we young officers became\n      reckless and apt to take undue risks on service.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Nevertheless, slowly, inch by inch as it were, our columns were closing\n      upon Gaspar Ruiz, though he had managed to raise all the Araucanian nation\n      of wild Indians against us. Then a year or more later our Government\n      became aware through its agents and spies that he had actually entered\n      into alliance with Carreras, the so-called dictator of the so-called\n      republic of Mendoza, on the other side of the mountains. Whether Gaspar\n      Ruiz had a deep political intention, or whether he wished only to secure a\n      safe retreat for his wife and child while he pursued remorselessly against\n      us his war of surprises and massacres, I cannot tell. The alliance,\n      however, was a fact. Defeated in his attempt to check our advance from the\n      sea, he retreated with his usual swiftness, and preparing for another hard\n      and hazardous tussle, began by sending his wife with the little girl\n      across the Pequena range of mountains, on the frontier of Mendoza.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      XI\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Now Carreras, under the guise of politics and liberalism, was a scoundrel\n      of the deepest dye, and the unhappy state of Mendoza was the prey of\n      thieves, robbers, traitors, and murderers, who formed his party. He was\n      under a noble exterior a man without heart, pity, honour, or conscience.\n      He aspired to nothing but tyranny, and though he would have made use of\n      Gaspar Ruiz for his nefarious designs, yet he soon became aware that to\n      propitiate the Chilian Government would answer his purpose better. I blush\n      to say that he made proposals to our Government to deliver up on certain\n      conditions the wife and child of the man who had trusted to his honour,\n      and that this offer was accepted.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;While on her way to Mendoza over the Pequena Pass she was betrayed by her\n      escort of Carreras&rsquo; men, and given up to the officer in command of a\n      Chilian fort on the upland at the foot of the main Cordillera range. This\n      atrocious transaction might have cost me dear, for as a matter of fact I\n      was a prisoner in Gaspar Ruiz&rsquo; camp when he received the news. I had been\n      captured during a reconnaissance, my escort of a few troopers being\n      speared by the Indians of his bodyguard. I was saved from the same fate\n      because he recognized my features just in time. No doubt my friends\n      thought I was dead, and I would not have given much for my life at any\n      time. But the strong man treated me very well, because, he said, I had\n      always believed in his innocence and had tried to serve him when he was a\n      victim of injustice.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;And now,&rsquo; was his speech to me, &lsquo;you shall see that I always speak the\n      truth. You are safe.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I did not think I was very safe when I was called up to go to him one\n      night. He paced up and down like a wild beast, exclaiming, &lsquo;Betrayed!\n      Betrayed!&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He walked up to me clenching his fists. &lsquo;I could cut your throat.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Will that give your wife back to you?&rsquo; I said as quietly as I could.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;And the child!&rsquo; he yelled out, as if mad. He fell into a chair and\n      laughed in a frightful, boisterous manner. &lsquo;Oh, no, you are safe.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I assured him that his wife&rsquo;s life was safe, too; but I did not say what\n      I was convinced of&mdash;that he would never see her again. He wanted war\n      to the death, and the war could only end with his death.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He gave me a strange, inexplicable look, and sat muttering blankly, &lsquo;In\n      their hands. In their hands.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I kept as still as a mouse before a cat.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Suddenly he jumped up. &lsquo;What am I doing here?&rsquo; he cried; and opening the\n      door, he yelled out orders to saddle and mount. &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; he\n      stammered, coming up to me. &lsquo;The Pequena fort; a fort of palisades!\n      Nothing. I would get her back if she were hidden in the very heart of the\n      mountain.&rsquo; He amazed me by adding, with an effort: &lsquo;I carried her off in\n      my two arms while the earth trembled. And the child at least is mine. She\n      at least is mine!&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Those were bizarre words; but I had no time for wonder.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;You shall go with me,&rsquo; he said, violently. &lsquo;I may want to parley, and\n      any other messenger from Ruiz, the outlaw, would have his throat cut.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;This was true enough. Between him and the rest of incensed mankind there\n      could be no communication, according to the customs of honourable warfare.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;In less than half an hour we were in the saddle, flying wildly through\n      the night. He had only an escort of twenty men at his quarters, but would\n      not wait for more. He sent, however, messengers to Peneleo, the Indian\n      chief then ranging in the foothills, directing him to bring his warriors\n      to the uplands and meet him at the lake called the Eye of Water, near\n      whose shores the frontier fort of Pequena was built.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;We crossed the lowlands with that untired rapidity of movement which had\n      made Gaspar Ruiz&rsquo; raids so famous. We followed the lower valleys up to\n      their precipitous heads. The ride was not without its dangers. A cornice\n      road on a perpendicular wall of basalt wound itself around a buttressing\n      rock, and at last we emerged from the gloom of a deep gorge upon the\n      upland of Pequena.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It was a plain of green wiry grass and thin flowering bushes; but high\n      above our heads patches of snow hung in the folds and crevices of the\n      great walls of rock. The little lake was as round as a staring eye. The\n      garrison of the fort were just driving in their small herd of cattle when\n      we appeared. Then the great wooden gates swung to, and that four-square\n      enclosure of broad blackened stakes pointed at the top and barely hiding\n      the grass roofs of the huts inside seemed deserted, empty, without a\n      single soul.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;But when summoned to surrender, by a man who at Gaspar Ruiz&rsquo; order rode\n      fearlessly forward those inside answered by a volley which rolled him and\n      his horse over. I heard Ruiz by my side grind his teeth. &lsquo;It does not\n      matter,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Now you go.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Torn and faded as its rags were, the vestiges of my uniform were\n      recognized, and I was allowed to approach within speaking distance; and\n      then I had to wait, because a voice clamouring through a loophole with joy\n      and astonishment would not allow me to place a word. It was the voice of\n      Major Pajol, an old friend. He, like my other comrades, had thought me\n      killed a long time ago.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Put spurs to your horse, man!&rsquo; he yelled, in the greatest excitement;\n      &lsquo;we will swing the gate open for you.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I let the reins fall out of my hand and shook my head. &lsquo;I am on my\n      honour,&rsquo; I cried.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;To him!&rsquo; he shouted, with infinite disgust.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;He promises you your life.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Our life is our own. And do you, Santierra, advise us to surrender to\n      that rastrero?&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;No!&rsquo; I shouted. &lsquo;But he wants his wife and child, and he can cut you off\n      from water.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Then she would be the first to suffer. You may tell him that. Look here&mdash;this\n      is all nonsense: we shall dash out and capture you.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;You shall not catch me alive,&rsquo; I said, firmly.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Imbecile!&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake,&rsquo; I continued, hastily, &lsquo;do not open the gate.&rsquo; And I\n      pointed at the multitude of Peneleo&rsquo;s Indians who covered the shores of\n      the lake.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I had never seen so many of these savages together. Their lances seemed\n      as numerous as stalks of grass. Their hoarse voices made a vast,\n      inarticulate sound like the murmur of the sea.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;My friend Pajol was swearing to himself. &lsquo;Well, then&mdash;go to the\n      devil!&rsquo; he shouted, exasperated. But as I swung round he repented, for I\n      heard him say hurriedly, &lsquo;Shoot the fool&rsquo;s horse before he gets away.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He had good marksmen. Two shots rang out, and in the very act of turning\n      my horse staggered, fell and lay still as if struck by lightning. I had my\n      feet out of the stirrups and rolled clear of him; but I did not attempt to\n      rise. Neither dared they rush out to drag me in.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The masses of Indians had begun to move upon the fort. They rode up in\n      squadrons, trailing their long chusos; then dismounted out of musket-shot,\n      and, throwing off their fur mantles, advanced naked to the attack,\n      stamping their feet and shouting in cadence. A sheet of flame ran three\n      times along the face of the fort without checking their steady march. They\n      crowded right up to the very stakes, flourishing their broad knives. But\n      this palisade was not fastened together with hide lashings in the usual\n      way, but with long iron nails, which they could not cut. Dismayed at the\n      failure of their usual method of forcing an entrance, the heathen, who had\n      marched so steadily against the musketry fire, broke and fled under the\n      volleys of the besieged.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Directly they had passed me on their advance I got up and rejoined Gaspar\n      Ruiz on a low ridge which jutted out upon the plain. The musketry of his\n      own men had covered the attack, but now at a sign from him a trumpet\n      sounded the &lsquo;Cease fire.&rsquo; Together we looked in silence at the hopeless\n      rout of the savages.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;It must be a siege, then,&rsquo; he muttered. And I detected him wringing his\n      hands stealthily.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;But what sort of siege could it be? Without any need for me to repeat my\n      friend Pajol&rsquo;s message, he dared not cut the water off from the besieged.\n      They had plenty of meat. And, indeed, if they had been short he would have\n      been too anxious to send food into the stockade had he been able. But, as\n      a matter of fact, it was we on the plain who were beginning to feel the\n      pinch of hunger.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Peneleo, the Indian chief, sat by our fire folded in his ample mantle of\n      guanaco skins. He was an athletic savage, with an enormous square shock\n      head of hair resembling a straw beehive in shape and size, and with grave,\n      surly, much-lined features. In his broken Spanish he repeated, growling\n      like a bad-tempered wild beast, that if an opening ever so small were made\n      in the stockade his men would march in and get the senora&mdash;not\n      otherwise.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Gaspar Ruiz, sitting opposite him, kept his eyes fixed on the fort night\n      and day as it were, in awful silence and immobility. Meantime, by runners\n      from the lowlands that arrived nearly every day, we heard of the defeat of\n      one of his lieutenants in the Maipu valley. Scouts sent afar brought news\n      of a column of infantry advancing through distant passes to the relief of\n      the fort. They were slow, but we could trace their toilful progress up the\n      lower valleys. I wondered why Ruiz did not march to attack and destroy\n      this threatening force, in some wild gorge fit for an ambuscade, in\n      accordance with his genius for guerilla warfare. But his genius seemed to\n      have abandoned him to his despair.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It was obvious to me that he could not tear himself away from the sight\n      of the fort. I protest to you, senores, that I was moved almost to pity by\n      the sight of this powerless strong man sitting on the ridge, indifferent\n      to sun, to rain, to cold, to wind; with his hands clasped round his legs\n      and his chin resting on his knees, gazing&mdash;gazing&mdash;gazing.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;And the fort he kept his eyes fastened on was as still and silent as\n      himself. The garrison gave no sign of life. They did not even answer the\n      desultory fire directed at the loopholes.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;One night, as I strolled past him, he, without changing his attitude,\n      spoke to me unexpectedly. &lsquo;I have sent for a gun,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I shall have\n      time to get her back and retreat before your Robles manages to crawl up\n      here.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He had sent for a gun to the plains.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It was long in coming, but at last it came. It was a seven-pounder field\n      gun. Dismounted and lashed crosswise to two long poles, it had been\n      carried up the narrow paths between two mules with ease. His wild cry of\n      exultation at daybreak when he saw the gun escort emerge from the valley\n      rings in my ears now.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;But, senores, I have no words to depict his amazement, his fury, his\n      despair and distraction, when he heard that the animal loaded with the\n      gun-carriage had, during the last night march, somehow or other tumbled\n      down a precipice. He broke into menaces of death and torture against the\n      escort. I kept out of his way all that day, lying behind some bushes, and\n      wondering what he would do now. Retreat was left for him, but he could not\n      retreat.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I saw below me his artillerist, Jorge, an old Spanish soldier, building\n      up a sort of structure with heaped-up saddles. The gun, ready loaded, was\n      lifted on to that, but in the act of firing the whole thing collapsed and\n      the shot flew high above the stockade.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Nothing more was attempted. One of the ammunition mules had been lost,\n      too, and they had no more than six shots to fire; ample enough to batter\n      down the gate providing the gun was well laid. This was impossible without\n      it being properly mounted. There was no time nor means to construct a\n      carriage. Already every moment I expected to hear Robles&rsquo; bugle-calls echo\n      amongst the crags.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Peneleo, wandering about uneasily, draped in his skins, sat down for a\n      moment near me growling his usual tale.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Make an entrada&mdash;a hole. If make a hole, bueno. If not make a hole,\n      then vamos&mdash;we must go away.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;After sunset I observed with surprise the Indians making preparations as\n      if for another assault. Their lines stood ranged in the shadows of the\n      mountains. On the plain in front of the fort gate I saw a group of men\n      swaying about in the same place.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I walked down the ridge disregarded. The moonlight in the clear air of\n      the uplands was bright as day, but the intense shadows confused my sight,\n      and I could not make out what they were doing. I heard the voice of Jorge,\n      the artillerist, say in a queer, doubtful tone, &lsquo;It is loaded, senor.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Then another voice in that group pronounced firmly the words, &lsquo;Bring the\n      riata here.&rsquo; It was the voice of Gaspar Ruiz.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;A silence fell, in which the popping shots of the besieged garrison rang\n      out sharply. They, too, had observed the group. But the distance was too\n      great and in the spatter of spent musket-balls cutting up the ground, the\n      group opened, closed, swayed, giving me a glimpse of busy stooping figures\n      in its midst. I drew nearer, doubting whether this was a weird vision, a\n      suggestive and insensate dream.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;A strangely stifled voice commanded, &lsquo;Haul the hitches tighter.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Si, senor,&rsquo; several other voices answered in tones of awed alacrity.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Then the stifled voice said: &lsquo;Like this. I must be free to breathe.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Then there was a concerned noise of many men together. &lsquo;Help him up,\n      hombres. Steady! Under the other arm.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;That deadened voice ordered: &lsquo;Bueno! Stand away from me, men.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I pushed my way through the recoiling circle, and heard once more that\n      same oppressed voice saying earnestly: &lsquo;Forget that I am a living man,\n      Jorge. Forget me altogether, and think of what you have to do.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Be without fear, senor. You are nothing to me but a gun-carriage, and I\n      shall not waste a shot.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I heard the spluttering of a port-fire, and smelt the saltpetre of the\n      match. I saw suddenly before me a nondescript shape on all fours like a\n      beast, but with a man&rsquo;s head drooping below a tubular projection over the\n      nape of the neck, and the gleam of a rounded mass of bronze on its back.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;In front of a silent semicircle of men it squatted alone, with Jorge\n      behind it and a trumpeter motionless, his trumpet in his hand, by its\n      side.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Jorge, bent double, muttered, port-fire in hand: &lsquo;An inch to the left,\n      senor. Too much. So. Now, if you let yourself down a little by letting\n      your elbows bend, I will . . .&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He leaped aside, lowering his port-fire, and a burst of flame darted out\n      of the muzzle of the gun lashed on the man&rsquo;s back.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Then Gaspar Ruiz lowered himself slowly. &lsquo;Good shot?&rsquo; he asked.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Full on, senor.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Then load again.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He lay there before me on his breast under the darkly glittering bronze\n      of his monstrous burden, such as no love or strength of man had ever had\n      to bear in the lamentable history of the world. His arms were spread out,\n      and he resembled a prostrate penitent on the moonlit ground.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Again I saw him raised to his hands and knees and the men stand away from\n      him, and old Jorge stoop glancing along the gun.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Left a little. Right an inch. Por Dios, senor, stop this trembling.\n      Where is your strength?&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The old gunner&rsquo;s voice was cracked with emotion. He stepped aside, and\n      quick as lightning brought the spark to the touch-hole.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Excellent!&rsquo; he cried, tearfully; but Gaspar Ruiz lay for a long time\n      silent, flattened on the ground.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;I am tired,&rsquo; he murmured at last. &lsquo;Will another shot do it?&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Without doubt,&rsquo; said Jorge, bending down to his ear.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Then&mdash;load,&rsquo; I heard him utter distinctly. &lsquo;Trumpeter!&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;I am here, senor, ready for your word.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Blow a blast at this word that shall be heard from one end of Chile to\n      the other,&rsquo; he said, in an extraordinarily strong voice. &lsquo;And you others\n      stand ready to cut this accursed riata, for then will be the time for me\n      to lead you in your rush. Now raise me up, and you, Jorge&mdash;be quick\n      with your aim.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The rattle of musketry from the fort nearly drowned his voice. The\n      palisade was wreathed in smoke and flame.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Exert your force forward against the recoil, mi amo,&rsquo; said the old\n      gunner, shakily. &lsquo;Dig your fingers into the ground. So. Now!&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;A cry of exultation escaped him after the shot. The trumpeter raised his\n      trumpet nearly to his lips and waited. But no word came from the prostrate\n      man. I fell on one knee, and heard all he had to say then.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Something broken,&rsquo; he whispered, lifting his head a little, and turning\n      his eyes towards me in his hopelessly crushed attitude.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;The gate hangs only by the splinters,&rsquo; yelled Jorge.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Gaspar Ruiz tried to speak, but his voice died out in his throat, and I\n      helped to roll the gun off his broken back. He was insensible.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I kept my lips shut, of course. The signal for the Indians to attack was\n      never given. Instead, the bugle-calls of the relieving force for which my\n      ears had thirsted so long, burst out, terrifying like the call of the Last\n      Day to our surprised enemies.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;A tornado, senores, a real hurricane of stampeded men, wild horses,\n      mounted Indians, swept over me as I cowered on the ground by the side of\n      Gaspar Ruiz, still stretched out on his face in the shape of a cross.\n      Peneleo, galloping for life, jabbed at me with his long chuso in passing&mdash;for\n      the sake of old acquaintance, I suppose. How I escaped the flying lead is\n      more difficult to explain. Venturing to rise on my knees too soon some\n      soldiers of the 17th Taltal regiment, in their hurry to get at something\n      alive, nearly bayoneted me on the spot. They looked very disappointed,\n      too, when, some officers galloping up drove them away with the flat of\n      their swords.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It was General Robles with his staff. He wanted badly to make some\n      prisoners. He, too, seemed disappointed for a moment. &lsquo;What! Is it you?&rsquo; \n      he cried. But he dismounted at once to embrace me, for he was an old\n      friend of my family. I pointed to the body at our feet, and said only\n      these two words:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Gaspar Ruiz.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He threw his arms up in astonishment.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Aha! Your strong man! Always to the last with your strong man. No\n      matter. He saved our lives when the earth trembled enough to make the\n      bravest faint with fear. I was frightened out of my wits. But he&mdash;no!\n      Que guape! Where&rsquo;s the hero who got the best of him? ha! ha! ha! What\n      killed him, chico?&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;His own strength, General,&rsquo; I answered.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      XII\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;But Gaspar Ruiz breathed yet. I had him carried in his poncho under the\n      shelter of some bushes on the very ridge from which he had been gazing so\n      fixedly at the fort while unseen death was hovering already over his head.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Our troops had bivouacked round the fort. Towards daybreak I was not\n      surprised to hear that I was designated to command the escort of a\n      prisoner who was to be sent down at once to Santiago. Of course the\n      prisoner was Gaspar Ruiz&rsquo; wife.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;I have named you out of regard for your feelings,&rsquo; General Robles\n      remarked. &lsquo;Though the woman really ought to be shot for all the harm she\n      has done to the Republic.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;And as I made a movement of shocked protest, he continued:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Now he is as well as dead, she is of no importance. Nobody will know\n      what to do with her. However, the Government wants her.&rsquo; He shrugged his\n      shoulders. &lsquo;I suppose he must have buried large quantities of his loot in\n      places that she alone knows of.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;At dawn I saw her coming up the ridge, guarded by two soldiers, and\n      carrying her child on her arm.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I walked to meet her.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Is he living yet?&rsquo; she asked, confronting me with that white, impassive\n      face he used to look at in an adoring way.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I bent my head, and led her round a clump of bushes without a word. His\n      eyes were open. He breathed with difficulty, and uttered her name with a\n      great effort.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Erminia!&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;She knelt at his head. The little girl, unconscious of him, and with her\n      big eyes looking about, began to chatter suddenly, in a joyous, thin\n      voice. She pointed a tiny finger at the rosy glow of sunrise behind the\n      black shapes of the peaks. And while that child-talk, incomprehensible and\n      sweet to the ear, lasted, those two, the dying man and the kneeling woman,\n      remained silent, looking into each other&rsquo;s eyes, listening to the frail\n      sound. Then the prattle stopped. The child laid its head against its\n      mother&rsquo;s breast and was still.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;It was for you,&rsquo; he began. &lsquo;Forgive.&rsquo; His voice failed him. Presently I\n      heard a mutter and caught the pitiful words: &lsquo;Not strong enough.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;She looked at him with an extraordinary intensity. He tried to smile, and\n      in a humble tone, &lsquo;Forgive me,&rsquo; he repeated. &lsquo;Leaving you . . .&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;She bent down, dry-eyed and in a steady voice: &lsquo;On all the earth I have\n      loved nothing but you, Gaspar,&rsquo; she said.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;His head made a movement. His eyes revived. &lsquo;At last!&rsquo; he sighed out.\n      Then, anxiously, &lsquo;But is this true . . . is this true?&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;As true as that there is no mercy and justice in this world,&rsquo; she\n      answered him, passionately. She stooped over his face. He tried to raise\n      his head, but it fell back, and when she kissed his lips he was already\n      dead. His glazed eyes stared at the sky, on which pink clouds floated very\n      high. But I noticed the eyelids of the child, pressed to its mother&rsquo;s\n      breast, droop and close slowly. She had gone to sleep.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The widow of Gaspar Ruiz, the strong man, allowed me to lead her away\n      without shedding a tear.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;For travelling we had arranged for her a sidesaddle very much like a\n      chair, with a board swung beneath to rest her feet on. And the first day\n      she rode without uttering a word, and hardly for one moment turning her\n      eyes away from the little girl, whom she held on her knees. At our first\n      camp I saw her during the night walking about, rocking the child in her\n      arms and gazing down at it by the light of the moon. After we had started\n      on our second day&rsquo;s march she asked me how soon we should come to the\n      first village of the inhabited country.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I said we should be there about noon.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;And will there be women there?&rsquo; she inquired.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I told her that it was a large village. &lsquo;There will be men and women\n      there, senora,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;whose hearts shall be made glad by the news that\n      all the unrest and war is over now.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, it is all over now,&rsquo; she repeated. Then, after a time: &lsquo;Senor\n      officer, what will your Government do with me?&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;I do not know, senora,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;They will treat you well, no doubt. We\n      republicans are not savages and take no vengeance on women.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;She gave me a look at the word &lsquo;republicans&rsquo; which I imagined full of\n      undying hate. But an hour or so afterwards, as we drew up to let the\n      baggage mules go first along a narrow path skirting a precipice, she\n      looked at me with such a white, troubled face that I felt a great pity for\n      her.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Senor officer,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I am weak, I tremble. It is an insensate\n      fear.&rsquo; And indeed her lips did tremble while she tried to smile, glancing\n      at the beginning of the narrow path which was not so dangerous after all.\n      &lsquo;I am afraid I shall drop the child. Gaspar saved your life, you remember.\n      . . . Take her from me.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I took the child out of her extended arms. &lsquo;Shut your eyes, senora, and\n      trust to your mule,&rsquo; I recommended.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;She did so, and with her pallor and her wasted, thin face she looked\n      deathlike. At a turn of the path where a great crag of purple porphyry\n      closes the view of the lowlands, I saw her open her eyes. I rode just\n      behind her holding the little girl with my right arm. &lsquo;The child is all\n      right,&rsquo; I cried encouragingly.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she answered, faintly; and then, to my intense terror, I saw her\n      stand up on the foot-rest, staring horribly, and throw herself forward\n      into the chasm on our right.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I cannot describe to you the sudden and abject fear that came over me at\n      that dreadful sight. It was a dread of the abyss, the dread of the crags\n      which seemed to nod upon me. My head swam. I pressed the child to my side\n      and sat my horse as still as a statue. I was speechless and cold all over.\n      Her mule staggered, sidling close to the rock, and then went on. My horse\n      only pricked up his ears with a slight snort. My heart stood still, and\n      from the depths of the precipice the stones rattling in the bed of the\n      furious stream made me almost insane with their sound.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Next moment we were round the turn and on a broad and grassy slope. And\n      then I yelled. My men came running back to me in great alarm. It seems\n      that at first I did nothing but shout, &lsquo;She has given the child into my\n      hands! She has given the child into my hands!&rsquo; The escort thought I had\n      gone mad.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      General Santierra ceased and got up from the table. &ldquo;And that is all,\n      senores,&rdquo; he concluded, with a courteous glance at his rising guests.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;But what became of the child. General?&rdquo; we asked.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Ah, the child, the child.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      He walked to one of the windows opening on his beautiful garden, the\n      refuge of his old days. Its fame was great in the land. Keeping us back\n      with a raised arm, he called out, &ldquo;Erminia, Erminia!&rdquo; and waited. Then his\n      cautioning arm dropped, and we crowded to the windows.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      From a clump of trees a woman had come upon the broad walk bordered with\n      flowers. We could hear the rustle of her starched petticoats and observed\n      the ample spread of her old-fashioned black silk skirt. She looked up, and\n      seeing all these eyes staring at her stopped, frowned, smiled, shook her\n      finger at the General, who was laughing boisterously, and drawing the\n      black lace on her head so as to partly conceal her haughty profile, passed\n      out of our sight, walking with stiff dignity.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;You have beheld the guardian angel of the old man&mdash;and her to whom\n      you owe all that is seemly and comfortable in my hospitality. Somehow,\n      senores, though the flame of love has been kindled early in my breast, I\n      have never married. And because of that perhaps the sparks of the sacred\n      fire are not yet extinct here.&rdquo; He struck his broad chest. &ldquo;Still alive,\n      still alive,&rdquo; he said, with serio-comic emphasis. &ldquo;But I shall not marry\n      now. She is General Santierra&rsquo;s adopted daughter and heiress.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      One of our fellow-guests, a young naval officer, described her afterwards\n      as a &ldquo;short, stout, old girl of forty or thereabouts.&rdquo; We had all noticed\n      that her hair was turning grey, and that she had very fine black eyes.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;And,&rdquo; General Santierra continued, &ldquo;neither would she ever hear of\n      marrying any one. A real calamity! Good, patient, devoted to the old man.\n      A simple soul. But I would not advise any of you to ask for her hand, for\n      if she took yours into hers it would be only to crush your bones. Ah! she\n      does not jest on that subject. And she is the own daughter of her father,\n      the strong man who perished through his own strength: the strength of his\n      body, of his simplicity&mdash;of his love!&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      <a name=\"link2H_4_0004\" id=\"link2H_4_0004\">\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\n    </p>\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\n    </div>\n    <h2>\n      THE INFORMER\n    </h2>\n    <h3>\n      AN IRONIC TALE\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n      Mr. X came to me, preceded by a letter of introduction from a good friend\n      of mine in Paris, specifically to see my collection of Chinese bronzes and\n      porcelain.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;My friend in Paris is a collector, too. He collects neither porcelain,\n      nor bronzes, nor pictures, nor medals, nor stamps, nor anything that could\n      be profitably dispersed under an auctioneer&rsquo;s hammer. He would reject,\n      with genuine surprise, the name of a collector. Nevertheless, that&rsquo;s what\n      he is by temperament. He collects acquaintances. It is delicate work. He\n      brings to it the patience, the passion, the determination of a true\n      collector of curiosities. His collection does not contain any royal\n      personages. I don&rsquo;t think he considers them sufficiently rare and\n      interesting; but, with that exception, he has met with and talked to\n      everyone worth knowing on any conceivable ground. He observes them,\n      listens to them, penetrates them, measures them, and puts the memory away\n      in the galleries of his mind. He has schemed, plotted, and travelled all\n      over Europe in order to add to his collection of distinguished personal\n      acquaintances.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;As he is wealthy, well connected, and unprejudiced, his collection is\n      pretty complete, including objects (or should I say subjects?) whose value\n      is unappreciated by the vulgar, and often unknown to popular fame. Of\n      trevolte of modern times. The world knows him as a revolutionary writer\n      whose savage irony has laid bare the rottenness of the most respectable\n      institutions. He has scalped every venerated head, and has mangled at the\n      stake of his wit every received opinion and every recognized principle of\n      conduct and policy. Who does not remember his flaming red revolutionary\n      pamphlets? Their sudden swarmings used to overwhelm the powers of every\n      Continental police like a plague of crimson gadflies. But this extreme\n      writer has been also the active inspirer of secret societies, the\n      mysterious unknown Number One of desperate conspiracies suspected and\n      unsuspected, matured or baffled. And the world at large has never had an\n      inkling of that fact! This accounts for him going about amongst us to this\n      day, a veteran of many subterranean campaigns, standing aside now, safe\n      within his reputation of merely the greatest destructive publicist that\n      ever lived.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Thus wrote my friend, adding that Mr. X was an enlightened connoisseur of\n      bronzes and china, and asking me to show him my collection.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      X turned up in due course. My treasures are disposed in three large rooms\n      without carpets and curtains. There is no other furniture than the etagres\n      and the glass cases whose contents shall be worth a fortune to my heirs. I\n      allow no fires to be lighted, for fear of accidents, and a fire-proof door\n      separates them from the rest of the house.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      It was a bitter cold day. We kept on our overcoats and hats. Middle-sized\n      and spare, his eyes alert in a long, Roman-nosed countenance, X walked on\n      his neat little feet, with short steps, and looked at my collection\n      intelligently. I hope I looked at him intelligently, too. A snow-white\n      moustache and imperial made his nutbrown complexion appear darker than it\n      really was. In his fur coat and shiny tall hat that terrible man looked\n      fashionable. I believe he belonged to a noble family, and could have\n      called himself Vicomte X de la Z if he chose. We talked nothing but\n      bronzes and porcelain. He was remarkably appreciative. We parted on\n      cordial terms.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Where he was staying I don&rsquo;t know. I imagine he must have been a lonely\n      man. Anarchists, I suppose, have no families&mdash;not, at any rate, as we\n      understand that social relation. Organization into families may answer to\n      a need of human nature, but in the last instance it is based on law, and\n      therefore must be something odious and impossible to an anarchist. But,\n      indeed, I don&rsquo;t understand anarchists. Does a man of that&mdash;of that&mdash;persuasion\n      still remain an anarchist when alone, quite alone and going to bed, for\n      instance? Does he lay his head on the pillow, pull his bedclothes over\n      him, and go to sleep with the necessity of the chambardement general, as\n      the French slang has it, of the general blow-up, always present to his\n      mind? And if so how can he? I am sure that if such a faith (or such a\n      fanaticism) once mastered my thoughts I would never be able to compose\n      myself sufficiently to sleep or eat or perform any of the routine acts of\n      daily life. I would want no wife, no children; I could have no friends, it\n      seems to me; and as to collecting bronzes or china, that, I should say,\n      would be quite out of the question. But I don&rsquo;t know. All I know is that\n      Mr. X took his meals in a very good restaurant which I frequented also.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      With his head uncovered, the silver top-knot of his brushed-up hair\n      completed the character of his physiognomy, all bony ridges and sunken\n      hollows, clothed in a perfect impassiveness of expression. His meagre\n      brown hands emerging from large white cuffs came and went breaking bread,\n      pouring wine, and so on, with quiet mechanical precision. His head and\n      body above the tablecloth had a rigid immobility. This firebrand, this\n      great agitator, exhibited the least possible amount of warmth and\n      animation. His voice was rasping, cold, and monotonous in a low key. He\n      could not be called a talkative personality; but with his detached calm\n      manner he appeared as ready to keep the conversation going as to drop it\n      at any moment.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      And his conversation was by no means commonplace. To me, I own, there was\n      some excitement in talking quietly across a dinner-table with a man whose\n      venomous pen-stabs had sapped the vitality of at least one monarchy. That\n      much was a matter of public knowledge. But I knew more. I knew of him&mdash;from\n      my friend&mdash;as a certainty what the guardians of social order in\n      Europe had at most only suspected, or dimly guessed at.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He had had what I may call his underground life. And as I sat, evening\n      after evening, facing him at dinner, a curiosity in that direction would\n      naturally arise in my mind. I am a quiet and peaceable product of\n      civilization, and know no passion other than the passion for collecting\n      things which are rare, and must remain exquisite even if approaching to\n      the monstrous. Some Chinese bronzes are monstrously precious. And here\n      (out of my friend&rsquo;s collection), here I had before me a kind of rare\n      monster. It is true that this monster was polished and in a sense even\n      exquisite. His beautiful unruffled manner was that. But then he was not of\n      bronze. He was not even Chinese, which would have enabled one to\n      contemplate him calmly across the gulf of racial difference. He was alive\n      and European; he had the manner of good society, wore a coat and hat like\n      mine, and had pretty near the same taste in cooking. It was too frightful\n      to think of.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      One evening he remarked, casually, in the course of conversation, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s\n      no amendment to be got out of mankind except by terror and violence.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      You can imagine the effect of such a phrase out of such a man&rsquo;s mouth upon\n      a person like myself, whose whole scheme of life had been based upon a\n      suave and delicate discrimination of social and artistic values. Just\n      imagine! Upon me, to whom all sorts and forms of violence appeared as\n      unreal as the giants, ogres, and seven-headed hydras whose activities\n      affect, fantastically, the course of legends and fairy-tales!\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      I seemed suddenly to hear above the festive bustle and clatter of the\n      brilliant restaurant the mutter of a hungry and seditious multitude.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      I suppose I am impressionable and imaginative. I had a disturbing vision\n      of darkness, full of lean jaws and wild eyes, amongst the hundred electric\n      lights of the place. But somehow this vision made me angry, too. The sight\n      of that man, so calm, breaking bits of white bread, exasperated me. And I\n      had the audacity to ask him how it was that the starving proletariat of\n      Europe to whom he had been preaching revolt and violence had not been made\n      indignant by his openly luxurious life. &ldquo;At all this,&rdquo; I said, pointedly,\n      with a glance round the room and at the bottle of champagne we generally\n      shared between us at dinner.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He remained unmoved.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Do I feed on their toil and their heart&rsquo;s blood? Am I a speculator or a\n      capitalist? Did I steal my fortune from a starving people? No! They know\n      this very well. And they envy me nothing. The miserable mass of the people\n      is generous to its leaders. What I have acquired has come to me through my\n      writings; not from the millions of pamphlets distributed gratis to the\n      hungry and the oppressed, but from the hundreds of thousands of copies\n      sold to the well-fed bourgeoisie. You know that my writings were at one\n      time the rage, the fashion&mdash;the thing to read with wonder and horror,\n      to turn your eyes up at my pathos . . . or else, to laugh in ecstasies at\n      my wit.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I admitted. &ldquo;I remember, of course; and I confess frankly that I\n      could never understand that infatuation.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know yet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that an idle and selfish class loves to\n      see mischief being made, even if it is made at its own expense? Its own\n      life being all a matter of pose and gesture, it is unable to realize the\n      power and the danger of a real movement and of words that have no sham\n      meaning. It is all fun and sentiment. It is sufficient, for instance, to\n      point out the attitude of the old French aristocracy towards the\n      philosophers whose words were preparing the Great Revolution. Even in\n      England, where you have some common-sense, a demagogue has only to shout\n      loud enough and long enough to find some backing in the very class he is\n      shouting at. You, too, like to see mischief being made. The demagogue\n      carries the amateurs of emotion with him. Amateurism in this, that, and\n      the other thing is a delightfully easy way of killing time, and feeding\n      one&rsquo;s own vanity&mdash;the silly vanity of being abreast with the ideas of\n      the day after to-morrow. Just as good and otherwise harmless people will\n      join you in ecstasies over your collection without having the slightest\n      notion in what its marvellousness really consists.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      I hung my head. It was a crushing illustration of the sad truth he\n      advanced. The world is full of such people. And that instance of the\n      French aristocracy before the Revolution was extremely telling, too. I\n      could not traverse his statement, though its cynicism&mdash;always a\n      distasteful trait&mdash;took off much of its value to my mind. However, I\n      admit I was impressed. I felt the need to say something which would not be\n      in the nature of assent and yet would not invite discussion.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say,&rdquo; I observed, airily, &ldquo;that extreme revolutionists\n      have ever been actively assisted by the infatuation of such people?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I did not mean exactly that by what I said just now. I generalized. But\n      since you ask me, I may tell you that such help has been given to\n      revolutionary activities, more or less consciously, in various countries.\n      And even in this country.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; I protested with firmness. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t play with fire to that\n      extent.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;And yet you can better afford it than others, perhaps. But let me observe\n      that most women, if not always ready to play with fire, are generally\n      eager to play with a loose spark or so.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Is this a joke?&rdquo; I asked, smiling.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;If it is, I am not aware of it,&rdquo; he said, woodenly. &ldquo;I was thinking of an\n      instance. Oh! mild enough in a way . . .&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      I became all expectation at this. I had tried many times to approach him\n      on his underground side, so to speak. The very word had been pronounced\n      between us. But he had always met me with his impenetrable calm.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;And at the same time,&rdquo; Mr. X continued, &ldquo;it will give you a notion of the\n      difficulties that may arise in what you are pleased to call underground\n      work. It is sometimes difficult to deal with them. Of course there is no\n      hierarchy amongst the affiliated. No rigid system.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      My surprise was great, but short-lived. Clearly, amongst extreme\n      anarchists there could be no hierarchy; nothing in the nature of a law of\n      precedence. The idea of anarchy ruling among anarchists was comforting,\n      too. It could not possibly make for efficiency.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Mr. X startled me by asking, abruptly, &ldquo;You know Hermione Street?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      I nodded doubtful assent. Hermione Street has been, within the last three\n      years, improved out of any man&rsquo;s knowledge. The name exists still, but not\n      one brick or stone of the old Hermione Street is left now. It was the old\n      street he meant, for he said:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;There was a row of two-storied brick houses on the left, with their backs\n      against the wing of a great public building&mdash;you remember. Would it\n      surprise you very much to hear that one of these houses was for a time the\n      centre of anarchist propaganda and of what you would call underground\n      action?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; I declared. Hermione Street had never been particularly\n      respectable, as I remembered it.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The house was the property of a distinguished government official,&rdquo; he\n      added, sipping his champagne.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo; I said, this time not believing a word of it.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Of course he was not living there,&rdquo; Mr. X continued. &ldquo;But from ten till\n      four he sat next door to it, the dear man, in his well-appointed private\n      room in the wing of the public building I&rsquo;ve mentioned. To be strictly\n      accurate, I must explain that the house in Hermione Street did not really\n      belong to him. It belonged to his grown-up children&mdash;a daughter and a\n      son. The girl, a fine figure, was by no means vulgarly pretty. To more\n      personal charm than mere youth could account for, she added the seductive\n      appearance of enthusiasm, of independence, of courageous thought. I\n      suppose she put on these appearances as she put on her picturesque dresses\n      and for the same reason: to assert her individuality at any cost. You\n      know, women would go to any length almost for such a purpose. She went to\n      a great length. She had acquired all the appropriate gestures of\n      revolutionary convictions&mdash;the gestures of pity, of anger, of\n      indignation against the anti-humanitarian vices of the social class to\n      which she belonged herself. All this sat on her striking personality as\n      well as her slightly original costumes. Very slightly original; just\n      enough to mark a protest against the philistinism of the overfed\n      taskmasters of the poor. Just enough, and no more. It would not have done\n      to go too far in that direction&mdash;you understand. But she was of age,\n      and nothing stood in the way of her offering her house to the\n      revolutionary workers.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean it!&rdquo; I cried.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I assure you,&rdquo; he affirmed, &ldquo;that she made that very practical gesture.\n      How else could they have got hold of it? The cause is not rich. And,\n      moreover, there would have been difficulties with any ordinary\n      house-agent, who would have wanted references and so on. The group she\n      came in contact with while exploring the poor quarters of the town (you\n      know the gesture of charity and personal service which was so fashionable\n      some years ago) accepted with gratitude. The first advantage was that\n      Hermione Street is, as you know, well away from the suspect part of the\n      town, specially watched by the police.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The ground floor consisted of a little Italian restaurant, of the\n      flyblown sort. There was no difficulty in buying the proprietor out. A\n      woman and a man belonging to the group took it on. The man had been a\n      cook. The comrades could get their meals there, unnoticed amongst the\n      other customers. This was another advantage. The first floor was occupied\n      by a shabby Variety Artists&rsquo; Agency&mdash;an agency for performers in\n      inferior music-halls, you know. A fellow called Bomm, I remember. He was\n      not disturbed. It was rather favourable than otherwise to have a lot of\n      foreign-looking people, jugglers, acrobats, singers of both sexes, and so\n      on, going in and out all day long. The police paid no attention to new\n      faces, you see. The top floor happened, most conveniently, to stand empty\n      then.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      X interrupted himself to attack impassively, with measured movements, a\n      bombe glacee which the waiter had just set down on the table. He swallowed\n      carefully a few spoonfuls of the iced sweet, and asked me, &ldquo;Did you ever\n      hear of Stone&rsquo;s Dried Soup?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Hear of what?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It was,&rdquo; X pursued, evenly, &ldquo;a comestible article once rather prominently\n      advertised in the dailies, but which never, somehow, gained the favour of\n      the public. The enterprise fizzled out, as you say here. Parcels of their\n      stock could be picked up at auctions at considerably less than a penny a\n      pound. The group bought some of it, and an agency for Stone&rsquo;s Dried Soup\n      was started on the top floor. A perfectly respectable business. The stuff,\n      a yellow powder of extremely unappetizing aspect, was put up in large\n      square tins, of which six went to a case. If anybody ever came to give an\n      order, it was, of course, executed. But the advantage of the powder was\n      this, that things could be concealed in it very conveniently. Now and then\n      a special case got put on a van and sent off to be exported abroad under\n      the very nose of the policeman on duty at the corner. You understand?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I think I do,&rdquo; I said, with an expressive nod at the remnants of the\n      bombe melting slowly in the dish.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Exactly. But the cases were useful in another way, too. In the basement,\n      or in the cellar at the back, rather, two printing-presses were\n      established. A lot of revolutionary literature of the most inflammatory\n      kind was got away from the house in Stone&rsquo;s Dried Soup cases. The brother\n      of our anarchist young lady found some occupation there. He wrote\n      articles, helped to set up type and pull off the sheets, and generally\n      assisted the man in charge, a very able young fellow called Sevrin.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The guiding spirit of that group was a fanatic of social revolution. He\n      is dead now. He was an engraver and etcher of genius. You must have seen\n      his work. It is much sought after by certain amateurs now. He began by\n      being revolutionary in his art, and ended by becoming a revolutionist,\n      after his wife and child had died in want and misery. He used to say that\n      the bourgeoisie, the smug, overfed lot, had killed them. That was his real\n      belief. He still worked at his art and led a double life. He was tall,\n      gaunt, and swarthy, with a long, brown beard and deep-set eyes. You must\n      have seen him. His name was Horne.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      At this I was really startled. Of course years ago I used to meet Horne\n      about. He looked like a powerful, rough gipsy, in an old top hat, with a\n      red muffler round his throat and buttoned up in a long, shabby overcoat.\n      He talked of his art with exaltation, and gave one the impression of being\n      strung up to the verge of insanity. A small group of connoisseurs\n      appreciated his work. Who would have thought that this man. . . . Amazing!\n      And yet it was not, after all, so difficult to believe.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;As you see,&rdquo; X went on, &ldquo;this group was in a position to pursue its work\n      of propaganda, and the other kind of work, too, under very advantageous\n      conditions. They were all resolute, experienced men of a superior stamp.\n      And yet we became struck at length by the fact that plans prepared in\n      Hermione Street almost invariably failed.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Who were &lsquo;we&rsquo;?&rdquo; I asked, pointedly.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Some of us in Brussels&mdash;at the centre,&rdquo; he said, hastily. &ldquo;Whatever\n      vigorous action originated in Hermione Street seemed doomed to failure.\n      Something always happened to baffle the best planned manifestations in\n      every part of Europe. It was a time of general activity. You must not\n      imagine that all our failures are of a loud sort, with arrests and trials.\n      That is not so. Often the police work quietly, almost secretly, defeating\n      our combinations by clever counter-plotting. No arrests, no noise, no\n      alarming of the public mind and inflaming the passions. It is a wise\n      procedure. But at that time the police were too uniformly successful from\n      the Mediterranean to the Baltic. It was annoying and began to look\n      dangerous. At last we came to the conclusion that there must be some\n      untrustworthy elements amongst the London groups. And I came over to see\n      what could be done quietly.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;My first step was to call upon our young Lady Amateur of anarchism at her\n      private house. She received me in a flattering way. I judged that she knew\n      nothing of the chemical and other operations going on at the top of the\n      house in Hermione Street. The printing of anarchist literature was the\n      only &lsquo;activity&rsquo; she seemed to be aware of there. She was displaying very\n      strikingly the usual signs of severe enthusiasm, and had already written\n      many sentimental articles with ferocious conclusions. I could see she was\n      enjoying herself hugely, with all the gestures and grimaces of deadly\n      earnestness. They suited her big-eyed, broad-browed face and the good\n      carriage of her shapely head, crowned by a magnificent lot of brown hair\n      done in an unusual and becoming style. Her brother was in the room, too, a\n      serious youth, with arched eyebrows and wearing a red necktie, who struck\n      me as being absolutely in the dark about everything in the world,\n      including himself. By and by a tall young man came in. He was clean-shaved\n      with a strong bluish jaw and something of the air of a taciturn actor or\n      of a fanatical priest: the type with thick black eyebrows&mdash;you know.\n      But he was very presentable indeed. He shook hands at once vigorously with\n      each of us. The young lady came up to me and murmured sweetly, &lsquo;Comrade\n      Sevrin.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I had never seen him before. He had little to say to us, but sat down by\n      the side of the girl, and they fell at once into earnest conversation. She\n      leaned forward in her deep armchair, and took her nicely rounded chin in\n      her beautiful white hand. He looked attentively into her eyes. It was the\n      attitude of love-making, serious, intense, as if on the brink of the\n      grave. I suppose she felt it necessary to round and complete her\n      assumption of advanced ideas, of revolutionary lawlessness, by making\n      believe to be in love with an anarchist. And this one, I repeat, was\n      extremely presentable, notwithstanding his fanatical black-browed aspect.\n      After a few stolen glances in their direction, I had no doubt that he was\n      in earnest. As to the lady, her gestures were unapproachable, better than\n      the very thing itself in the blended suggestion of dignity, sweetness,\n      condescension, fascination, surrender, and reserve. She interpreted her\n      conception of what that precise sort of love-making should be with\n      consummate art. And so far, she, too, no doubt, was in earnest. Gestures&mdash;but\n      so perfect!\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;After I had been left alone with our Lady Amateur I informed her\n      guardedly of the object of my visit. I hinted at our suspicions. I wanted\n      to hear what she would have to say, and half expected some perhaps\n      unconscious revelation. All she said was, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s serious,&rsquo; looking\n      delightfully concerned and grave. But there was a sparkle in her eyes\n      which meant plainly, &lsquo;How exciting!&rsquo; After all, she knew little of\n      anything except of words. Still, she undertook to put me in communication\n      with Horne, who was not easy to find unless in Hermione Street, where I\n      did not wish to show myself just then.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I met Horne. This was another kind of a fanatic altogether. I exposed to\n      him the conclusion we in Brussels had arrived at, and pointed out the\n      significant series of failures. To this he answered with irrelevant\n      exaltation:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;I have something in hand that shall strike terror into the heart of\n      these gorged brutes.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;And then I learned that, by excavating in one of the cellars of the\n      house, he and some companions had made their way into the vaults under the\n      great public building I have mentioned before. The blowing up of a whole\n      wing was a certainty as soon as the materials were ready.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I was not so appalled at the stupidity of that move as I might have been\n      had not the usefulness of our centre in Hermione Street become already\n      very problematical. In fact, in my opinion it was much more of a police\n      trap by this time than anything else.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;What was necessary now was to discover what, or rather who, was wrong,\n      and I managed at last to get that idea into Horne&rsquo;s head. He glared,\n      perplexed, his nostrils working as if he were sniffing treachery in the\n      air.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;And here comes a piece of work which will no doubt strike you as a sort\n      of theatrical expedient. And yet what else could have been done? The\n      problem was to find out the untrustworthy member of the group. But no\n      suspicion could be fastened on one more than another. To set a watch upon\n      them all was not very practicable. Besides, that proceeding often fails.\n      In any case, it takes time, and the danger was pressing. I felt certain\n      that the premises in Hermione Street would be ultimately raided, though\n      the police had evidently such confidence in the informer that the house,\n      for the time being, was not even watched. Horne was positive on that\n      point. Under the circumstances it was an unfavourable symptom. Something\n      had to be done quickly.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I decided to organize a raid myself upon the group. Do you understand? A\n      raid of other trusty comrades personating the police. A conspiracy within\n      a conspiracy. You see the object of it, of course. When apparently about\n      to be arrested I hoped the informer would betray himself in some way or\n      other; either by some unguarded act or simply by his unconcerned\n      demeanour, for instance. Of coarse there was the risk of complete failure\n      and the no lesser risk of some fatal accident in the course of resistance,\n      perhaps, or in the efforts at escape. For, as you will easily see, the\n      Hermione Street group had to be actually and completely taken unawares, as\n      I was sure they would be by the real police before very long. The informer\n      was amongst them, and Horne alone could be let into the secret of my plan.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I will not enter into the detail of my preparations. It was not very easy\n      to arrange, but it was done very well, with a really convincing effect.\n      The sham police invaded the restaurant, whose shutters were immediately\n      put up. The surprise was perfect. Most of the Hermione Street party were\n      found in the second cellar, enlarging the hole communicating with the\n      vaults of the great public building. At the first alarm, several comrades\n      bolted through impulsively into the aforesaid vault, where, of course, had\n      this been a genuine raid, they would have been hopelessly trapped. We did\n      not bother about them for the moment. They were harmless enough. The top\n      floor caused considerable anxiety to Horne and myself. There, surrounded\n      by tins of Stone&rsquo;s Dried Soup, a comrade, nick-named the Professor (he was\n      an ex-science student) was engaged in perfecting some new detonators. He\n      was an abstracted, self-confident, sallow little man, armed with large\n      round spectacles, and we were afraid that under a mistaken impression he\n      would blow himself up and wreck the house about our ears. I rushed\n      upstairs and found him already at the door, on the alert, listening, as he\n      said, to &lsquo;suspicious noises down below.&rsquo; Before I had quite finished\n      explaining to him what was going on he shrugged his shoulders disdainfully\n      and turned away to his balances and test-tubes. His was the true spirit of\n      an extreme revolutionist. Explosives were his faith, his hope, his weapon,\n      and his shield. He perished a couple of years afterwards in a secret\n      laboratory through the premature explosion of one of his improved\n      detonators.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Hurrying down again, I found an impressive scene in the gloom of the big\n      cellar. The man who personated the inspector (he was no stranger to the\n      part) was speaking harshly, and giving bogus orders to his bogus\n      subordinates for the removal of his prisoners. Evidently nothing\n      enlightening had happened so far. Horne, saturnine and swarthy, waited\n      with folded arms, and his patient, moody expectation had an air of\n      stoicism well in keeping with the situation. I detected in the shadows one\n      of the Hermione Street group surreptitiously chewing up and swallowing a\n      small piece of paper. Some compromising scrap, I suppose; perhaps just a\n      note of a few names and addresses. He was a true and faithful &lsquo;companion.&rsquo; \n      But the fund of secret malice which lurks at the bottom of our sympathies\n      caused me to feel amused at that perfectly uncalled-for performance.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;In every other respect the risky experiment, the theatrical coup, if you\n      like to call it so, seemed to have failed. The deception could not be kept\n      up much longer; the explanation would bring about a very embarrassing and\n      even grave situation. The man who had eaten the paper would be furious.\n      The fellows who had bolted away would be angry, too.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;To add to my vexation, the door communicating with the other cellar,\n      where the printing-presses were, flew open, and our young lady\n      revolutionist appeared, a black silhouette in a close-fitting dress and a\n      large hat, with the blaze of gas flaring in there at her back. Over her\n      shoulder I perceived the arched eyebrows and the red necktie of her\n      brother.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The last people in the world I wanted to see then! They had gone that\n      evening to some amateur concert for the delectation of the poor people,\n      you know; but she had insisted on leaving early, on purpose to call in\n      Hermione Street on the way home, under the pretext of having some work to\n      do. Her usual task was to correct the proofs of the Italian and French\n      editions of the Alarm Bell and the Firebrand.&rdquo; . . .\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; I murmured. I had been shown once a few copies of these\n      publications. Nothing, in my opinion, could have been less fit for the\n      eyes of a young lady. They were the most advanced things of the sort;\n      advanced, I mean, beyond all bounds of reason and decency. One of them\n      preached the dissolution of all social and domestic ties; the other\n      advocated systematic murder. To think of a young girl calmly tracking\n      printers&rsquo; errors all along the sort of abominable sentences I remembered\n      was intolerable to my sentiment of womanhood. Mr. X, after giving me a\n      glance, pursued steadily.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I think, however, that she came mostly to exercise her fascinations upon\n      Sevrin, and to receive his homage in her queenly and condescending way.\n      She was aware of both&mdash;her power and his homage&mdash;and enjoyed\n      them with, I dare say, complete innocence. We have no ground in expediency\n      or morals to quarrel with her on that account. Charm in woman and\n      exceptional intelligence in man are a law unto themselves. Is it not so?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      I refrained from expressing my abhorrence of that licentious doctrine\n      because of my curiosity.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;But what happened then?&rdquo; I hastened to ask.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      X went on crumbling slowly a small piece of bread with a careless left\n      hand.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;What happened, in effect,&rdquo; he confessed, &ldquo;is that she saved the\n      situation.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;She gave you an opportunity to end your rather sinister farce,&rdquo; I\n      suggested.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, preserving his impassive bearing. &ldquo;The farce was bound to\n      end soon. And it ended in a very few minutes. And it ended well. Had she\n      not come in, it might have ended badly. Her brother, of course, did not\n      count. They had slipped into the house quietly some time before. The\n      printing-cellar had an entrance of its own. Not finding any one there, she\n      sat down to her proofs, expecting Sevrin to return to his work at any\n      moment. He did not do so. She grew impatient, heard through the door the\n      sounds of a disturbance in the other cellar and naturally came in to see\n      what was the matter.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Sevrin had been with us. At first he had seemed to me the most amazed of\n      the whole raided lot. He appeared for an instant as if paralyzed with\n      astonishment. He stood rooted to the spot. He never moved a limb. A\n      solitary gas-jet flared near his head; all the other lights had been put\n      out at the first alarm. And presently, from my dark corner, I observed on\n      his shaven actor&rsquo;s face an expression of puzzled, vexed watchfulness. He\n      knitted his heavy eyebrows. The corners of his mouth dropped scornfully.\n      He was angry. Most likely he had seen through the game, and I regretted I\n      had not taken him from the first into my complete confidence.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;But with the appearance of the girl he became obviously alarmed. It was\n      plain. I could see it grow. The change of his expression was swift and\n      startling. And I did not know why. The reason never occurred to me. I was\n      merely astonished at the extreme alteration of the man&rsquo;s face. Of course\n      he had not been aware of her presence in the other cellar; but that did\n      not explain the shock her advent had given him. For a moment he seemed to\n      have been reduced to imbecility. He opened his mouth as if to shout, or\n      perhaps only to gasp. At any rate, it was somebody else who shouted. This\n      somebody else was the heroic comrade whom I had detected swallowing a\n      piece of paper. With laudable presence of mind he let out a warning yell.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s the police! Back! Back! Run back, and bolt the door behind you.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It was an excellent hint; but instead of retreating the girl continued to\n      advance, followed by her long-faced brother in his knickerbocker suit, in\n      which he had been singing comic songs for the entertainment of a joyless\n      proletariat. She advanced not as if she had failed to understand&mdash;the\n      word &lsquo;police&rsquo; has an unmistakable sound&mdash;but rather as if she could\n      not help herself. She did not advance with the free gait and expanding\n      presence of a distinguished amateur anarchist amongst poor, struggling\n      professionals, but with slightly raised shoulders, and her elbows pressed\n      close to her body, as if trying to shrink within herself. Her eyes were\n      fixed immovably upon Sevrin. Sevrin the man, I fancy; not Sevrin the\n      anarchist. But she advanced. And that was natural. For all their\n      assumption of independence, girls of that class are used to the feeling of\n      being specially protected, as, in fact, they are. This feeling accounts\n      for nine tenths of their audacious gestures. Her face had gone completely\n      colourless. Ghastly. Fancy having it brought home to her so brutally that\n      she was the sort of person who must run away from the police! I believe\n      she was pale with indignation, mostly, though there was, of course, also\n      the concern for her intact personality, a vague dread of some sort of\n      rudeness. And, naturally, she turned to a man, to the man on whom she had\n      a claim of fascination and homage&mdash;the man who could not conceivably\n      fail her at any juncture.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I cried, amazed at this analysis, &ldquo;if it had been serious, real, I\n      mean&mdash;as she thought it was&mdash;what could she expect him to do for\n      her?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      X never moved a muscle of his face.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Goodness knows. I imagine that this charming, generous, and independent\n      creature had never known in her life a single genuine thought; I mean a\n      single thought detached from small human vanities, or whose source was not\n      in some conventional perception. All I know is that after advancing a few\n      steps she extended her hand towards the motionless Sevrin. And that at\n      least was no gesture. It was a natural movement. As to what she expected\n      him to do, who can tell? The impossible. But whatever she expected, it\n      could not have come up, I am safe to say, to what he had made up his mind\n      to do, even before that entreating hand had appealed to him so directly.\n      It had not been necessary. From the moment he had seen her enter that\n      cellar, he had made up his mind to sacrifice his future usefulness, to\n      throw off the impenetrable, solidly fastened mask it had been his pride to\n      wear&mdash;&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I interrupted, puzzled. &ldquo;Was it Sevrin, then, who was&mdash;&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He was. The most persistent, the most dangerous, the craftiest, the most\n      systematic of informers. A genius amongst betrayers. Fortunately for us,\n      he was unique. The man was a fanatic, I have told you. Fortunately, again,\n      for us, he had fallen in love with the accomplished and innocent gestures\n      of that girl. An actor in desperate earnest himself, he must have believed\n      in the absolute value of conventional signs. As to the grossness of the\n      trap into which he fell, the explanation must be that two sentiments of\n      such absorbing magnitude cannot exist simultaneously in one heart. The\n      danger of that other and unconscious comedian robbed him of his vision, of\n      his perspicacity, of his judgment. Indeed, it did at first rob him of his\n      self-possession. But he regained that through the necessity&mdash;as it\n      appeared to him imperiously&mdash;to do something at once. To do what?\n      Why, to get her out of the house as quickly as possible. He was\n      desperately anxious to do that. I have told you he was terrified. It could\n      not be about himself. He had been surprised and annoyed at a move quite\n      unforeseen and premature. I may even say he had been furious. He was\n      accustomed to arrange the last scene of his betrayals with a deep, subtle\n      art which left his revolutionist reputation untouched. But it seems clear\n      to me that at the same time he had resolved to make the best of it, to\n      keep his mask resolutely on. It was only with the discovery of her being\n      in the house that everything&mdash;the forced calm, the restraint of his\n      fanaticism, the mask&mdash;all came off together in a kind of panic. Why\n      panic, do you ask? The answer is very simple. He remembered&mdash;or, I\n      dare say, he had never forgotten&mdash;the Professor alone at the top of\n      the house, pursuing his researches, surrounded by tins upon tins of\n      Stone&rsquo;s Dried Soup. There was enough in some few of them to bury us all\n      where we stood under a heap of bricks. Sevrin, of course, was aware of\n      that. And we must believe, also, that he knew the exact character of the\n      man. He had gauged so many such characters! Or perhaps he only gave the\n      Professor credit for what he himself was capable of. But, in any case, the\n      effect was produced. And suddenly he raised his voice in authority.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Get the lady away at once.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It turned out that he was as hoarse as a crow; result, no doubt, of the\n      intense emotion. It passed off in a moment. But these fateful words issued\n      forth from his contracted throat in a discordant, ridiculous croak. They\n      required no answer. The thing was done. However, the man personating the\n      inspector judged it expedient to say roughly:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;She shall go soon enough, together with the rest of you.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;These were the last words belonging to the comedy part of this affair.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Oblivious of everything and everybody, Sevrin strode towards him and\n      seized the lapels of his coat. Under his thin bluish cheeks one could see\n      his jaws working with passion.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;You have men posted outside. Get the lady taken home at once. Do you\n      hear? Now. Before you try to get hold of the man upstairs.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh! There is a man upstairs,&rsquo; scoffed the other, openly. &lsquo;Well, he shall\n      be brought down in time to see the end of this.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;But Sevrin, beside himself, took no heed of the tone.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s the imbecile meddler who sent you blundering here? Didn&rsquo;t you\n      understand your instructions? Don&rsquo;t you know anything? It&rsquo;s incredible.\n      Here&mdash;&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He dropped the lapels of the coat and, plunging his hand into his breast,\n      jerked feverishly at something under his shirt. At last he produced a\n      small square pocket of soft leather, which must have been hanging like a\n      scapulary from his neck by the tape whose broken ends dangled from his\n      fist.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Look inside,&rsquo; he spluttered, flinging it in the other&rsquo;s face. And\n      instantly he turned round towards the girl. She stood just behind him,\n      perfectly still and silent. Her set, white face gave an illusion of\n      placidity. Only her staring eyes seemed bigger and darker.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He spoke rapidly, with nervous assurance. I heard him distinctly promise\n      her to make everything as clear as daylight presently. But that was all I\n      caught. He stood close to her, never attempting to touch her even with the\n      tip of his little finger&mdash;and she stared at him stupidly. For a\n      moment, however, her eyelids descended slowly, pathetically, and then,\n      with the long black eyelashes lying on her white cheeks, she looked ready\n      to fall down in a swoon. But she never even swayed where she stood. He\n      urged her loudly to follow him at once, and walked towards the door at the\n      bottom of the cellar stairs without looking behind him. And, as a matter\n      of fact, she did move after him a pace or two. But, of course, he was not\n      allowed to reach the door. There were angry exclamations, a short, fierce\n      scuffle. Flung away violently, he came flying backwards upon her, and\n      fell. She threw out her arms in a gesture of dismay and stepped aside,\n      just clear of his head, which struck the ground heavily near her shoe.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He grunted with the shock. By the time he had picked himself up, slowly,\n      dazedly, he was awake to the reality of things. The man into whose hands\n      he had thrust the leather case had extracted therefrom a narrow strip of\n      bluish paper. He held it up above his head, and, as after the scuffle an\n      expectant uneasy stillness reigned once more, he threw it down\n      disdainfully with the words, &lsquo;I think, comrades, that this proof was\n      hardly necessary.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Quick as thought, the girl stooped after the fluttering slip. Holding it\n      spread out in both hands, she looked at it; then, without raising her\n      eyes, opened her fingers slowly and let it fall.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I examined that curious document afterwards. It was signed by a very high\n      personage, and stamped and countersigned by other high officials in\n      various countries of Europe. In his trade&mdash;or shall I say, in his\n      mission?&mdash;that sort of talisman might have been necessary, no doubt.\n      Even to the police itself&mdash;all but the heads&mdash;he had been known\n      only as Sevrin the noted anarchist.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He hung his head, biting his lower lip. A change had come over him, a\n      sort of thoughtful, absorbed calmness. Nevertheless, he panted. His sides\n      worked visibly, and his nostrils expanded and collapsed in weird contrast\n      with his sombre aspect of a fanatical monk in a meditative attitude, but\n      with something, too, in his face of an actor intent upon the terrible\n      exigencies of his part. Before him Horne declaimed, haggard and bearded,\n      like an inspired denunciatory prophet from a wilderness. Two fanatics.\n      They were made to understand each other. Does this surprise you? I suppose\n      you think that such people would be foaming at the mouth and snarling at\n      each other?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      I protested hastily that I was not surprised in the least; that I thought\n      nothing of the kind; that anarchists in general were simply inconceivable\n      to me mentally, morally, logically, sentimentally, and even physically. X\n      received this declaration with his usual woodenness and went on.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Horne had burst out into eloquence. While pouring out scornful invective,\n      he let tears escape from his eyes and roll down his black beard unheeded.\n      Sevrin panted quicker and quicker. When he opened his mouth to speak,\n      everyone hung on his words.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool, Horne,&rsquo; he began. &lsquo;You know very well that I have done\n      this for none of the reasons you are throwing at me.&rsquo; And in a moment he\n      became outwardly as steady as a rock under the other&rsquo;s lurid stare. &lsquo;I\n      have been thwarting, deceiving, and betraying you&mdash;from conviction.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He turned his back on Horne, and addressing the girl, repeated the words:\n      &lsquo;From conviction.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s extraordinary how cold she looked. I suppose she could not think of\n      any appropriate gesture. There can have been few precedents indeed for\n      such a situation.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Clear as daylight,&rsquo; he added. &lsquo;Do you understand what that means? From\n      conviction.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;And still she did not stir. She did not know what to do. But the luckless\n      wretch was about to give her the opportunity for a beautiful and correct\n      gesture.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;I have felt in me the power to make you share this conviction,&rsquo; he\n      protested, ardently. He had forgotten himself; he made a step towards her&mdash;perhaps\n      he stumbled. To me he seemed to be stooping low as if to touch the hem of\n      her garment. And then the appropriate gesture came. She snatched her skirt\n      away from his polluting contact and averted her head with an upward tilt.\n      It was magnificently done, this gesture of conventionally unstained\n      honour, of an unblemished high-minded amateur.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Nothing could have been better. And he seemed to think so, too, for once\n      more he turned away. But this time he faced no one. He was again panting\n      frightfully, while he fumbled hurriedly in his waistcoat pocket, and then\n      raised his hand to his lips. There was something furtive in this movement,\n      but directly afterwards his bearing changed. His laboured breathing gave\n      him a resemblance to a man who had just run a desperate race; but a\n      curious air of detachment, of sudden and profound indifference, replaced\n      the strain of the striving effort. The race was over. I did not want to\n      see what would happen next. I was only too well aware. I tucked the young\n      lady&rsquo;s arm under mine without a word, and made my way with her to the\n      stairs.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Her brother walked behind us. Half-way up the short flight she seemed\n      unable to lift her feet high enough for the steps, and we had to pull and\n      push to get her to the top. In the passage she dragged herself along,\n      hanging on my arm, helplessly bent like an old woman. We issued into an\n      empty street through a half-open door, staggering like besotted revellers.\n      At the corner we stopped a four-wheeler, and the ancient driver looked\n      round from his box with morose scorn at our efforts to get her in. Twice\n      during the drive I felt her collapse on my shoulder in a half faint.\n      Facing us, the youth in knickerbockers remained as mute as a fish, and,\n      till he jumped out with the latch-key, sat more still than I would have\n      believed it possible.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;At the door of their drawing-room she left my arm and walked in first,\n      catching at the chairs and tables. She unpinned her hat, then, exhausted\n      with the effort, her cloak still hanging from her shoulders, flung herself\n      into a deep armchair, sideways, her face half buried in a cushion. The\n      good brother appeared silently before her with a glass of water. She\n      motioned it away. He drank it himself and walked off to a distant corner&mdash;behind\n      the grand piano, somewhere. All was still in this room where I had seen,\n      for the first time, Sevrin, the anti-anarchist, captivated and spellbound\n      by the consummate and hereditary grimaces that in a certain sphere of life\n      take the place of feelings with an excellent effect. I suppose her\n      thoughts were busy with the same memory. Her shoulders shook violently. A\n      pure attack of nerves. When it quieted down she affected firmness, &lsquo;What\n      is done to a man of that sort? What will they do to him?&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nothing. They can do nothing to him,&rsquo; I assured her, with perfect truth.\n      I was pretty certain he had died in less than twenty minutes from the\n      moment his hand had gone to his lips. For if his fanatical anti-anarchism\n      went even as far as carrying poison in his pocket, only to rob his\n      adversaries of legitimate vengeance, I knew he would take care to provide\n      something that would not fail him when required.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;She drew an angry breath. There were red spots on her cheeks and a\n      feverish brilliance in her eyes.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Has ever any one been exposed to such a terrible experience? To think\n      that he had held my hand! That man!&rsquo; Her face twitched, she gulped down a\n      pathetic sob. &lsquo;If I ever felt sure of anything, it was of Sevrin&rsquo;s\n      high-minded motives.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Then she began to weep quietly, which was good for her. Then through her\n      flood of tears, half resentful, &lsquo;What was it he said to me?&mdash;&ldquo;From\n      conviction!&rdquo; It seemed a vile mockery. What could he mean by it?&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;That, my dear young lady,&rsquo; I said, gently, &lsquo;is more than I or anybody\n      else can ever explain to you.&rsquo;&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Mr. X flicked a crumb off the front of his coat.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;And that was strictly true as to her. Though Horne, for instance,\n      understood very well; and so did I, especially after we had been to\n      Sevrin&rsquo;s lodging in a dismal back street of an intensely respectable\n      quarter. Horne was known there as a friend, and we had no difficulty in\n      being admitted, the slatternly maid merely remarking, as she let us in,\n      that &lsquo;Mr Sevrin had not been home that night.&rsquo; We forced open a couple of\n      drawers in the way of duty, and found a little useful information. The\n      most interesting part was his diary; for this man, engaged in such deadly\n      work, had the weakness to keep a record of the most damnatory kind. There\n      were his acts and also his thoughts laid bare to us. But the dead don&rsquo;t\n      mind that. They don&rsquo;t mind anything.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;From conviction.&rsquo; Yes. A vague but ardent humanitarianism had urged him\n      in his first youth into the bitterest extremity of negation and revolt.\n      Afterwards his optimism flinched. He doubted and became lost. You have\n      heard of converted atheists. These turn often into dangerous fanatics, but\n      the soul remains the same. After he had got acquainted with the girl,\n      there are to be met in that diary of his very queer politico-amorous\n      rhapsodies. He took her sovereign grimaces with deadly seriousness. He\n      longed to convert her. But all this cannot interest you. For the rest, I\n      don&rsquo;t know if you remember&mdash;it is a good many years ago now&mdash;the\n      journalistic sensation of the &lsquo;Hermione Street Mystery&rsquo;; the finding of a\n      man&rsquo;s body in the cellar of an empty house; the inquest; some arrests;\n      many surmises&mdash;then silence&mdash;the usual end for many obscure\n      martyrs and confessors. The fact is, he was not enough of an optimist. You\n      must be a savage, tyrannical, pitiless, thick-and-thin optimist, like\n      Horne, for instance, to make a good social rebel of the extreme type.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He rose from the table. A waiter hurried up with his overcoat; another\n      held his hat in readiness.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;But what became of the young lady?&rdquo; I asked.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Do you really want to know?&rdquo; he said, buttoning himself in his fur coat\n      carefully. &ldquo;I confess to the small malice of sending her Sevrin&rsquo;s diary.\n      She went into retirement; then she went to Florence; then she went into\n      retreat in a convent. I can&rsquo;t tell where she will go next. What does it\n      matter? Gestures! Gestures! Mere gestures of her class.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He fitted on his glossy high hat with extreme precision, and casting a\n      rapid glance round the room, full of well-dressed people, innocently\n      dining, muttered between his teeth:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;And nothing else! That is why their kind is fated to perish.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I never met Mr. X again after that evening. I took to dining at my club.\n      On my next visit to Paris I found my friend all impatience to hear of the\n      effect produced on me by this rare item of his collection. I told him all\n      the story, and he beamed on me with the pride of his distinguished\n      specimen.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t X well worth knowing?&rsquo; he bubbled over in great delight. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s\n      unique, amazing, absolutely terrific.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;His enthusiasm grated upon my finer feelings. I told him curtly that the\n      man&rsquo;s cynicism was simply abominable.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, abominable! abominable!&rsquo; assented my friend, effusively. &lsquo;And then,\n      you know, he likes to have his little joke sometimes,&rsquo; he added in a\n      confidential tone.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I fail to understand the connection of this last remark. I have been\n      utterly unable to discover where in all this the joke comes in.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      <a name=\"link2H_4_0005\" id=\"link2H_4_0005\">\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\n    </p>\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\n    </div>\n    <h2>\n      THE BRUTE\n    </h2>\n    <h3>\n      AN INDIGNANT TALE\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n      Dodging in from the rain-swept street, I exchanged a smile and a glance\n      with Miss Blank in the bar of the Three Crows. This exchange was effected\n      with extreme propriety. It is a shock to think that, if still alive, Miss\n      Blank must be something over sixty now. How time passes!\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Noticing my gaze directed inquiringly at the partition of glass and\n      varnished wood, Miss Blank was good enough to say, encouragingly:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Only Mr. Jermyn and Mr. Stonor in the parlour with another gentleman I&rsquo;ve\n      never seen before.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      I moved towards the parlour door. A voice discoursing on the other side\n      (it was but a matchboard partition), rose so loudly that the concluding\n      words became quite plain in all their atrocity.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;That fellow Wilmot fairly dashed her brains out, and a good job, too!&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      This inhuman sentiment, since there was nothing profane or improper in it,\n      failed to do as much as to check the slight yawn Miss Blank was achieving\n      behind her hand. And she remained gazing fixedly at the window-panes,\n      which streamed with rain.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      As I opened the parlour door the same voice went on in the same cruel\n      strain:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I was glad when I heard she got the knock from somebody at last. Sorry\n      enough for poor Wilmot, though. That man and I used to be chums at one\n      time. Of course that was the end of him. A clear case if there ever was\n      one. No way out of it. None at all.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The voice belonged to the gentleman Miss Blank had never seen before. He\n      straddled his long legs on the hearthrug. Jermyn, leaning forward, held\n      his pocket-handkerchief spread out before the grate. He looked back\n      dismally over his shoulder, and as I slipped behind one of the little\n      wooden tables, I nodded to him. On the other side of the fire, imposingly\n      calm and large, sat Mr. Stonor, jammed tight into a capacious Windsor\n      armchair. There was nothing small about him but his short, white\n      side-whiskers. Yards and yards of extra superfine blue cloth (made up into\n      an overcoat) reposed on a chair by his side. And he must just have brought\n      some liner from sea, because another chair was smothered under his black\n      waterproof, ample as a pall, and made of three-fold oiled silk,\n      double-stitched throughout. A man&rsquo;s hand-bag of the usual size looked like\n      a child&rsquo;s toy on the floor near his feet.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      I did not nod to him. He was too big to be nodded to in that parlour. He\n      was a senior Trinity pilot and condescended to take his turn in the cutter\n      only during the summer months. He had been many times in charge of royal\n      yachts in and out of Port Victoria. Besides, it&rsquo;s no use nodding to a\n      monument. And he was like one. He didn&rsquo;t speak, he didn&rsquo;t budge. He just\n      sat there, holding his handsome old head up, immovable, and almost bigger\n      than life. It was extremely fine. Mr. Stonor&rsquo;s presence reduced poor old\n      Jermyn to a mere shabby wisp of a man, and made the talkative stranger in\n      tweeds on the hearthrug look absurdly boyish. The latter must have been a\n      few years over thirty, and was certainly not the sort of individual that\n      gets abashed at the sound of his own voice, because gathering me in, as it\n      were, by a friendly glance, he kept it going without a check.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I was glad of it,&rdquo; he repeated, emphatically. &ldquo;You may be surprised at\n      it, but then you haven&rsquo;t gone through the experience I&rsquo;ve had of her. I\n      can tell you, it was something to remember. Of course, I got off scot free\n      myself&mdash;as you can see. She did her best to break up my pluck for me\n      tho&rsquo;. She jolly near drove as fine a fellow as ever lived into a madhouse.\n      What do you say to that&mdash;eh?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Not an eyelid twitched in Mr. Stonor&rsquo;s enormous face. Monumental! The\n      speaker looked straight into my eyes.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It used to make me sick to think of her going about the world murdering\n      people.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Jermyn approached the handkerchief a little nearer to the grate and\n      groaned. It was simply a habit he had.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen her once,&rdquo; he declared, with mournful indifference. &ldquo;She had a\n      house&mdash;&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The stranger in tweeds turned to stare down at him, surprised.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;She had three houses,&rdquo; he corrected, authoritatively. But Jermyn was not\n      to be contradicted.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;She had a house, I say,&rdquo; he repeated, with dismal obstinacy. &ldquo;A great,\n      big, ugly, white thing. You could see it from miles away&mdash;sticking\n      up.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;So you could,&rdquo; assented the other readily. &ldquo;It was old Colchester&rsquo;s\n      notion, though he was always threatening to give her up. He couldn&rsquo;t stand\n      her racket any more, he declared; it was too much of a good thing for him;\n      he would wash his hands of her, if he never got hold of another&mdash;and\n      so on. I daresay he would have chucked her, only&mdash;it may surprise you&mdash;his\n      missus wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it. Funny, eh? But with women, you never know how\n      they will take a thing, and Mrs. Colchester, with her moustaches and big\n      eyebrows, set up for being as strong-minded as they make them. She used to\n      walk about in a brown silk dress, with a great gold cable flopping about\n      her bosom. You should have heard her snapping out: &lsquo;Rubbish!&rsquo; or &lsquo;Stuff\n      and nonsense!&rsquo; I daresay she knew when she was well off. They had no\n      children, and had never set up a home anywhere. When in England she just\n      made shift to hang out anyhow in some cheap hotel or boarding-house. I\n      daresay she liked to get back to the comforts she was used to. She knew\n      very well she couldn&rsquo;t gain by any change. And, moreover, Colchester,\n      though a first-rate man, was not what you may call in his first youth,\n      and, perhaps, she may have thought that he wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get hold of\n      another (as he used to say) so easily. Anyhow, for one reason or another,\n      it was &lsquo;Rubbish&rsquo; and &lsquo;Stuff and nonsense&rsquo; for the good lady. I overheard\n      once young Mr. Apse himself say to her confidentially: &lsquo;I assure you, Mrs.\n      Colchester, I am beginning to feel quite unhappy about the name she&rsquo;s\n      getting for herself.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; says she, with her deep little hoarse laugh,\n      &lsquo;if one took notice of all the silly talk,&rsquo; and she showed Apse all her\n      ugly false teeth at once. &lsquo;It would take more than that to make me lose my\n      confidence in her, I assure you,&rsquo; says she.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      At this point, without any change of facial expression, Mr. Stonor emitted\n      a short, sardonic laugh. It was very impressive, but I didn&rsquo;t see the fun.\n      I looked from one to another. The stranger on the hearthrug had an ugly\n      smile.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;And Mr. Apse shook both Mrs. Colchester&rsquo;s hands, he was so pleased to\n      hear a good word said for their favourite. All these Apses, young and old\n      you know, were perfectly infatuated with that abominable, dangerous&mdash;&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; I interrupted, for he seemed to be addressing himself\n      exclusively to me; &ldquo;but who on earth are you talking about?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I am talking of the Apse family,&rdquo; he answered, courteously.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      I nearly let out a damn at this. But just then the respected Miss Blank\n      put her head in, and said that the cab was at the door, if Mr. Stonor\n      wanted to catch the eleven three up.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      At once the senior pilot arose in his mighty bulk and began to struggle\n      into his coat, with awe-inspiring upheavals. The stranger and I hurried\n      impulsively to his assistance, and directly we laid our hands on him he\n      became perfectly quiescent. We had to raise our arms very high, and to\n      make efforts. It was like caparisoning a docile elephant. With a &ldquo;Thanks,\n      gentlemen,&rdquo; he dived under and squeezed himself through the door in a\n      great hurry.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      We smiled at each other in a friendly way.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I wonder how he manages to hoist himself up a ship&rsquo;s side-ladder,&rdquo; said\n      the man in tweeds; and poor Jermyn, who was a mere North Sea pilot,\n      without official status or recognition of any sort, pilot only by\n      courtesy, groaned.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He makes eight hundred a year.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Are you a sailor?&rdquo; I asked the stranger, who had gone back to his\n      position on the rug.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I used to be till a couple of years ago, when I got married,&rdquo; answered\n      this communicative individual. &ldquo;I even went to sea first in that very ship\n      we were speaking of when you came in.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;What ship?&rdquo; I asked, puzzled. &ldquo;I never heard you mention a ship.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just told you her name, my dear sir,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;The Apse Family.\n      Surely you&rsquo;ve heard of the great firm of Apse &amp; Sons, shipowners. They\n      had a pretty big fleet. There was the Lucy Apse, and the Harold Apse, and\n      Anne, John, Malcolm, Clara, Juliet, and so on&mdash;no end of Apses. Every\n      brother, sister, aunt, cousin, wife&mdash;and grandmother, too, for all I\n      know&mdash;of the firm had a ship named after them. Good, solid,\n      old-fashioned craft they were, too, built to carry and to last. None of\n      your new-fangled, labour-saving appliances in them, but plenty of men and\n      plenty of good salt beef and hard tack put aboard&mdash;and off you go to\n      fight your way out and home again.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The miserable Jermyn made a sound of approval, which sounded like a groan\n      of pain. Those were the ships for him. He pointed out in doleful tones\n      that you couldn&rsquo;t say to labour-saving appliances: &ldquo;Jump lively now, my\n      hearties.&rdquo; No labour-saving appliance would go aloft on a dirty night with\n      the sands under your lee.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; assented the stranger, with a wink at me. &ldquo;The Apses didn&rsquo;t believe\n      in them either, apparently. They treated their people well&mdash;as people\n      don&rsquo;t get treated nowadays, and they were awfully proud of their ships.\n      Nothing ever happened to them. This last one, the Apse Family, was to be\n      like the others, only she was to be still stronger, still safer, still\n      more roomy and comfortable. I believe they meant her to last for ever.\n      They had her built composite&mdash;iron, teak-wood, and greenheart, and\n      her scantling was something fabulous. If ever an order was given for a\n      ship in a spirit of pride this one was. Everything of the best. The\n      commodore captain of the employ was to command her, and they planned the\n      accommodation for him like a house on shore under a big, tall poop that\n      went nearly to the mainmast. No wonder Mrs. Colchester wouldn&rsquo;t let the\n      old man give her up. Why, it was the best home she ever had in all her\n      married days. She had a nerve, that woman.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The fuss that was made while that ship was building! Let&rsquo;s have this a\n      little stronger, and that a little heavier; and hadn&rsquo;t that other thing\n      better be changed for something a little thicker. The builders entered\n      into the spirit of the game, and there she was, growing into the\n      clumsiest, heaviest ship of her size right before all their eyes, without\n      anybody becoming aware of it somehow. She was to be 2,000 tons register,\n      or a little over; no less on any account. But see what happens. When they\n      came to measure her she turned out 1,999 tons and a fraction. General\n      consternation! And they say old Mr. Apse was so annoyed when they told him\n      that he took to his bed and died. The old gentleman had retired from the\n      firm twenty-five years before, and was ninety-six years old if a day, so\n      his death wasn&rsquo;t, perhaps, so surprising. Still Mr. Lucian Apse was\n      convinced that his father would have lived to a hundred. So we may put him\n      at the head of the list. Next comes the poor devil of a shipwright that\n      brute caught and squashed as she went off the ways. They called it the\n      launch of a ship, but I&rsquo;ve heard people say that, from the wailing and\n      yelling and scrambling out of the way, it was more like letting a devil\n      loose upon the river. She snapped all her checks like pack-thread, and\n      went for the tugs in attendance like a fury. Before anybody could see what\n      she was up to she sent one of them to the bottom, and laid up another for\n      three months&rsquo; repairs. One of her cables parted, and then, suddenly&mdash;you\n      couldn&rsquo;t tell why&mdash;she let herself be brought up with the other as\n      quiet as a lamb.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how she was. You could never be sure what she would be up to next.\n      There are ships difficult to handle, but generally you can depend on them\n      behaving rationally. With that ship, whatever you did with her you never\n      knew how it would end. She was a wicked beast. Or, perhaps, she was only\n      just insane.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      He uttered this supposition in so earnest a tone that I could not refrain\n      from smiling. He left off biting his lower lip to apostrophize me.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Eh! Why not? Why couldn&rsquo;t there be something in her build, in her lines\n      corresponding to&mdash;What&rsquo;s madness? Only something just a tiny bit\n      wrong in the make of your brain. Why shouldn&rsquo;t there be a mad ship&mdash;I\n      mean mad in a ship-like way, so that under no circumstances could you be\n      sure she would do what any other sensible ship would naturally do for you.\n      There are ships that steer wildly, and ships that can&rsquo;t be quite trusted\n      always to stay; others want careful watching when running in a gale; and,\n      again, there may be a ship that will make heavy weather of it in every\n      little blow. But then you expect her to be always so. You take it as part\n      of her character, as a ship, just as you take account of a man&rsquo;s\n      peculiarities of temper when you deal with him. But with her you couldn&rsquo;t.\n      She was unaccountable. If she wasn&rsquo;t mad, then she was the most\n      evil-minded, underhand, savage brute that ever went afloat. I&rsquo;ve seen her\n      run in a heavy gale beautifully for two days, and on the third broach to\n      twice in the same afternoon. The first time she flung the helmsman clean\n      over the wheel, but as she didn&rsquo;t quite manage to kill him she had another\n      try about three hours afterwards. She swamped herself fore and aft, burst\n      all the canvas we had set, scared all hands into a panic, and even\n      frightened Mrs. Colchester down there in these beautiful stern cabins that\n      she was so proud of. When we mustered the crew there was one man missing.\n      Swept overboard, of course, without being either seen or heard, poor\n      devil! and I only wonder more of us didn&rsquo;t go.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Always something like that. Always. I heard an old mate tell Captain\n      Colchester once that it had come to this with him, that he was afraid to\n      open his mouth to give any sort of order. She was as much of a terror in\n      harbour as at sea. You could never be certain what would hold her. On the\n      slightest provocation she would start snapping ropes, cables, wire\n      hawsers, like carrots. She was heavy, clumsy, unhandy&mdash;but that does\n      not quite explain that power for mischief she had. You know, somehow, when\n      I think of her I can&rsquo;t help remembering what we hear of incurable lunatics\n      breaking loose now and then.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      He looked at me inquisitively. But, of course, I couldn&rsquo;t admit that a\n      ship could be mad.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;In the ports where she was known,&rdquo; he went on,&rsquo; &ldquo;they dreaded the sight\n      of her. She thought nothing of knocking away twenty feet or so of solid\n      stone facing off a quay or wiping off the end of a wooden wharf. She must\n      have lost miles of chain and hundreds of tons of anchors in her time. When\n      she fell aboard some poor unoffending ship it was the very devil of a job\n      to haul her off again. And she never got hurt herself&mdash;just a few\n      scratches or so, perhaps. They had wanted to have her strong. And so she\n      was. Strong enough to ram Polar ice with. And as she began so she went on.\n      From the day she was launched she never let a year pass without murdering\n      somebody. I think the owners got very worried about it. But they were a\n      stiff-necked generation all these Apses; they wouldn&rsquo;t admit there could\n      be anything wrong with the Apse Family. They wouldn&rsquo;t even change her\n      name. &lsquo;Stuff and nonsense,&rsquo; as Mrs. Colchester used to say. They ought at\n      least to have shut her up for life in some dry dock or other, away up the\n      river, and never let her smell salt water again. I assure you, my dear\n      sir, that she invariably did kill someone every voyage she made. It was\n      perfectly well-known. She got a name for it, far and wide.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      I expressed my surprise that a ship with such a deadly reputation could\n      ever get a crew.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Then, you don&rsquo;t know what sailors are, my dear sir. Let me just show you\n      by an instance. One day in dock at home, while loafing on the forecastle\n      head, I noticed two respectable salts come along, one a middle-aged,\n      competent, steady man, evidently, the other a smart, youngish chap. They\n      read the name on the bows and stopped to look at her. Says the elder man:\n      &lsquo;Apse Family. That&rsquo;s the sanguinary female dog&rsquo; (I&rsquo;m putting it in that\n      way) &lsquo;of a ship, Jack, that kills a man every voyage. I wouldn&rsquo;t sign in\n      her&mdash;not for Joe, I wouldn&rsquo;t.&rsquo; And the other says: &lsquo;If she were mine,\n      I&rsquo;d have her towed on the mud and set on fire, blame if I wouldn&rsquo;t.&rsquo; Then\n      the first man chimes in: &lsquo;Much do they care! Men are cheap, God knows.&rsquo; \n      The younger one spat in the water alongside. &lsquo;They won&rsquo;t have me&mdash;not\n      for double wages.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;They hung about for some time and then walked up the dock. Half an hour\n      later I saw them both on our deck looking about for the mate, and\n      apparently very anxious to be taken on. And they were.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;How do you account for this?&rdquo; I asked.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;What would you say?&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;Recklessness! The vanity of boasting\n      in the evening to all their chums: &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve just shipped in that there Apse\n      Family. Blow her. She ain&rsquo;t going to scare us.&rsquo; Sheer sailorlike\n      perversity! A sort of curiosity. Well&mdash;a little of all that, no\n      doubt. I put the question to them in the course of the voyage. The answer\n      of the elderly chap was:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;A man can die but once.&rsquo; The younger assured me in a mocking tone that\n      he wanted to see &lsquo;how she would do it this time.&rsquo; But I tell you what;\n      there was a sort of fascination about the brute.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Jermyn, who seemed to have seen every ship in the world, broke in sulkily:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I saw her once out of this very window towing up the river; a great black\n      ugly thing, going along like a big hearse.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Something sinister about her looks, wasn&rsquo;t there?&rdquo; said the man in\n      tweeds, looking down at old Jermyn with a friendly eye. &ldquo;I always had a\n      sort of horror of her. She gave me a beastly shock when I was no more than\n      fourteen, the very first day&mdash;nay, hour&mdash;I joined her. Father\n      came up to see me off, and was to go down to Gravesend with us. I was his\n      second boy to go to sea. My big brother was already an officer then. We.\n      got on board about eleven in the morning, and found the ship ready to drop\n      out of the basin, stern first. She had not moved three times her own\n      length when, at a little pluck the tug gave her to enter the dock gates,\n      she made one of her rampaging starts, and put such a weight on the check\n      rope&mdash;a new six-inch hawser&mdash;that forward there they had no\n      chance to ease it round in time, and it parted. I saw the broken end fly\n      up high in the air, and the next moment that brute brought her quarter\n      against the pier-head with a jar that staggered everybody about her decks.\n      She didn&rsquo;t hurt herself. Not she! But one of the boys the mate had sent\n      aloft on the mizzen to do something, came down on the poop-deck&mdash;thump&mdash;right\n      in front of me. He was not much older than myself. We had been grinning at\n      each other only a few minutes before. He must have been handling himself\n      carelessly, not expecting to get such a jerk. I heard his startled cry&mdash;Oh!&mdash;in\n      a high treble as he felt himself going, and looked up in time to see him\n      go limp all over as he fell. Ough! Poor father was remarkably white about\n      the gills when we shook hands in Gravesend. &lsquo;Are you all right?&rsquo; he says,\n      looking hard at me. &lsquo;Yes, father.&rsquo; &lsquo;Quite sure?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, father.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well,\n      then good-bye, my boy.&rsquo; He told me afterwards that for half a word he\n      would have carried me off home with him there and then. I am the baby of\n      the family&mdash;you know,&rdquo; added the man in tweeds, stroking his\n      moustache with an ingenuous smile.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      I acknowledged this interesting communication by a sympathetic murmur. He\n      waved his hand carelessly.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;This might have utterly spoiled a chap&rsquo;s nerve for going aloft, you know&mdash;utterly.\n      He fell within two feet of me, cracking his head on a mooring-bitt. Never\n      moved. Stone dead. Nice looking little fellow, he was. I had just been\n      thinking we would be great chums. However, that wasn&rsquo;t yet the worst that\n      brute of a ship could do. I served in her three years of my time, and then\n      I got transferred to the Lucy Apse, for a year. The sailmaker we had in\n      the Apse Family turned up there, too, and I remember him saying to me one\n      evening, after we had been a week at sea: Isn&rsquo;t she a meek little ship?&rsquo; \n      No wonder we thought the Lucy Apse a dear, meek, little ship after getting\n      clear of that big, rampaging savage brute. It was like heaven. Her\n      officers seemed to me the restfullest lot of men on earth. To me who had\n      known no ship but the Apse Family, the Lucy was like a sort of magic craft\n      that did what you wanted her to do of her own accord. One evening we got\n      caught aback pretty sharply from right ahead. In about ten minutes we had\n      her full again, sheets aft, tacks down, decks cleared, and the officer of\n      the watch leaning against the weather rail peacefully. It seemed simply\n      marvellous to me. The other would have stuck for half-an-hour in irons,\n      rolling her decks full of water, knocking the men about&mdash;spars\n      cracking, braces snapping, yards taking charge, and a confounded scare\n      going on aft because of her beastly rudder, which she had a way of\n      flapping about fit to raise your hair on end. I couldn&rsquo;t get over my\n      wonder for days.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Well, I finished my last year of apprenticeship in that jolly little ship&mdash;she\n      wasn&rsquo;t so little either, but after that other heavy devil she seemed but a\n      plaything to handle. I finished my time and passed; and then just as I was\n      thinking of having three weeks of real good time on shore I got at\n      breakfast a letter asking me the earliest day I could be ready to join the\n      Apse Family as third mate. I gave my plate a shove that shot it into the\n      middle of the table; dad looked up over his paper; mother raised her hands\n      in astonishment, and I went out bare-headed into our bit of garden, where\n      I walked round and round for an hour.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;When I came in again mother was out of the dining-room, and dad had\n      shifted berth into his big armchair. The letter was lying on the\n      mantelpiece.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s very creditable to you to get the offer, and very kind of them to\n      make it,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;And I see also that Charles has been appointed chief\n      mate of that ship for one voyage.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;There was, over leaf, a P.S. to that effect in Mr. Apse&rsquo;s own\n      handwriting, which I had overlooked. Charley was my big brother.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like very much to have two of my boys together in one ship,&rsquo; \n      father goes on, in his deliberate, solemn way. &lsquo;And I may tell you that I\n      would not mind writing Mr. Apse a letter to that effect.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Dear old dad! He was a wonderful father. What would you have done? The\n      mere notion of going back (and as an officer, too), to be worried and\n      bothered, and kept on the jump night and day by that brute, made me feel\n      sick. But she wasn&rsquo;t a ship you could afford to fight shy of. Besides, the\n      most genuine excuse could not be given without mortally offending Apse\n      &amp; Sons. The firm, and I believe the whole family down to the old\n      unmarried aunts in Lancashire, had grown desperately touchy about that\n      accursed ship&rsquo;s character. This was the case for answering &lsquo;Ready now&rsquo; \n      from your very death-bed if you wished to die in their good graces. And\n      that&rsquo;s precisely what I did answer&mdash;by wire, to have it over and done\n      with at once.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The prospect of being shipmates with my big brother cheered me up\n      considerably, though it made me a bit anxious, too. Ever since I remember\n      myself as a little chap he had been very good to me, and I looked upon him\n      as the finest fellow in the world. And so he was. No better officer ever\n      walked the deck of a merchant ship. And that&rsquo;s a fact. He was a fine,\n      strong, upstanding, sun-tanned, young fellow, with his brown hair curling\n      a little, and an eye like a hawk. He was just splendid. We hadn&rsquo;t seen\n      each other for many years, and even this time, though he had been in\n      England three weeks already, he hadn&rsquo;t showed up at home yet, but had\n      spent his spare time in Surrey somewhere making up to Maggie Colchester,\n      old Captain Colchester&rsquo;s niece. Her father, a great friend of dad&rsquo;s, was\n      in the sugar-broking business, and Charley made a sort of second home of\n      their house. I wondered what my big brother would think of me. There was a\n      sort of sternness about Charley&rsquo;s face which never left it, not even when\n      he was larking in his rather wild fashion.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He received me with a great shout of laughter. He seemed to think my\n      joining as an officer the greatest joke in the world. There was a\n      difference of ten years between us, and I suppose he remembered me best in\n      pinafores. I was a kid of four when he first went to sea. It surprised me\n      to find how boisterous he could be.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Now we shall see what you are made of,&rsquo; he cried. And he held me off by\n      the shoulders, and punched my ribs, and hustled me into his berth. &lsquo;Sit\n      down, Ned. I am glad of the chance of having you with me. I&rsquo;ll put the\n      finishing touch to you, my young officer, providing you&rsquo;re worth the\n      trouble. And, first of all, get it well into your head that we are not\n      going to let this brute kill anybody this voyage. We&rsquo;ll stop her racket.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I perceived he was in dead earnest about it. He talked grimly of the\n      ship, and how we must be careful and never allow this ugly beast to catch\n      us napping with any of her damned tricks.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He gave me a regular lecture on special seamanship for the use of the\n      Apse Family; then changing his tone, he began to talk at large, rattling\n      off the wildest, funniest nonsense, till my sides ached with laughing. I\n      could see very well he was a bit above himself with high spirits. It\n      couldn&rsquo;t be because of my coming. Not to that extent. But, of course, I\n      wouldn&rsquo;t have dreamt of asking what was the matter. I had a proper respect\n      for my big brother, I can tell you. But it was all made plain enough a day\n      or two afterwards, when I heard that Miss Maggie Colchester was coming for\n      the voyage. Uncle was giving her a sea-trip for the benefit of her health.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what could have been wrong with her health. She had a\n      beautiful colour, and a deuce of a lot of fair hair. She didn&rsquo;t care a rap\n      for wind, or rain, or spray, or sun, or green seas, or anything. She was a\n      blue-eyed, jolly girl of the very best sort, but the way she cheeked my\n      big brother used to frighten me. I always expected it to end in an awful\n      row. However, nothing decisive happened till after we had been in Sydney\n      for a week. One day, in the men&rsquo;s dinner hour, Charley sticks his head\n      into my cabin. I was stretched out on my back on the settee, smoking in\n      peace.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Come ashore with me, Ned,&rsquo; he says, in his curt way.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I jumped up, of course, and away after him down the gangway and up George\n      Street. He strode along like a giant, and I at his elbow, panting. It was\n      confoundedly hot. &lsquo;Where on earth are you rushing me to, Charley?&rsquo; I made\n      bold to ask.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Here,&rsquo; he says.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Here&rsquo; was a jeweller&rsquo;s shop. I couldn&rsquo;t imagine what he could want\n      there. It seemed a sort of mad freak. He thrusts under my nose three\n      rings, which looked very tiny on his big, brown palm, growling out&mdash;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;For Maggie! Which?&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I got a kind of scare at this. I couldn&rsquo;t make a sound, but I pointed at\n      the one that sparkled white and blue. He put it in his waistcoat pocket,\n      paid for it with a lot of sovereigns, and bolted out. When we got on board\n      I was quite out of breath. &lsquo;Shake hands, old chap,&rsquo; I gasped out. He gave\n      me a thump on the back. &lsquo;Give what orders you like to the boatswain when\n      the hands turn-to,&rsquo; says he; &lsquo;I am off duty this afternoon.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Then he vanished from the deck for a while, but presently he came out of\n      the cabin with Maggie, and these two went over the gangway publicly,\n      before all hands, going for a walk together on that awful, blazing hot\n      day, with clouds of dust flying about. They came back after a few hours\n      looking very staid, but didn&rsquo;t seem to have the slightest idea where they\n      had been. Anyway, that&rsquo;s the answer they both made to Mrs. Colchester&rsquo;s\n      question at tea-time.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;And didn&rsquo;t she turn on Charley, with her voice like an old night\n      cabman&rsquo;s! &lsquo;Rubbish. Don&rsquo;t know where you&rsquo;ve been! Stuff and nonsense.\n      You&rsquo;ve walked the girl off her legs. Don&rsquo;t do it again.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s surprising how meek Charley could be with that old woman. Only on\n      one occasion he whispered to me, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m jolly glad she isn&rsquo;t Maggie&rsquo;s aunt,\n      except by marriage. That&rsquo;s no sort of relationship.&rsquo; But I think he let\n      Maggie have too much of her own way. She was hopping all over that ship in\n      her yachting skirt and a red tam o&rsquo; shanter like a bright bird on a dead\n      black tree. The old salts used to grin to themselves when they saw her\n      coming along, and offered to teach her knots or splices. I believe she\n      liked the men, for Charley&rsquo;s sake, I suppose.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;As you may imagine, the fiendish propensities of that cursed ship were\n      never spoken of on board. Not in the cabin, at any rate. Only once on the\n      homeward passage Charley said, incautiously, something about bringing all\n      her crew home this time. Captain Colchester began to look uncomfortable at\n      once, and that silly, hard-bitten old woman flew out at Charley as though\n      he had said something indecent. I was quite confounded myself; as to\n      Maggie, she sat completely mystified, opening her blue eyes very wide. Of\n      course, before she was a day older she wormed it all out of me. She was a\n      very difficult person to lie to.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;How awful,&rsquo; she said, quite solemn. &lsquo;So many poor fellows. I am glad the\n      voyage is nearly over. I won&rsquo;t have a moment&rsquo;s peace about Charley now.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I assured her Charley was all right. It took more than that ship knew to\n      get over a seaman like Charley. And she agreed with me.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Next day we got the tug off Dungeness; and when the tow-rope was fast\n      Charley rubbed his hands and said to me in an undertone&mdash;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve baffled her, Ned.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Looks like it,&rsquo; I said, with a grin at him. It was beautiful weather,\n      and the sea as smooth as a millpond. We went up the river without a shadow\n      of trouble except once, when off Hole Haven, the brute took a sudden sheer\n      and nearly had a barge anchored just clear of the fairway. But I was aft,\n      looking after the steering, and she did not catch me napping that time.\n      Charley came up on the poop, looking very concerned. &lsquo;Close shave,&rsquo; says\n      he.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Never mind, Charley,&rsquo; I answered, cheerily. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve tamed her.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;We were to tow right up to the dock. The river pilot boarded us below\n      Gravesend, and the first words I heard him say were: &lsquo;You may just as well\n      take your port anchor inboard at once, Mr. Mate.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;This had been done when I went forward. I saw Maggie on the forecastle\n      head enjoying the bustle and I begged her to go aft, but she took no\n      notice of me, of course. Then Charley, who was very busy with the head\n      gear, caught sight of her and shouted in his biggest voice: &lsquo;Get off the\n      forecastle head, Maggie. You&rsquo;re in the way here.&rsquo; For all answer she made\n      a funny face at him, and I saw poor Charley turn away, hiding a smile. She\n      was flushed with the excitement of getting home again, and her blue eyes\n      seemed to snap electric sparks as she looked at the river. A collier brig\n      had gone round just ahead of us, and our tug had to stop her engines in a\n      hurry to avoid running into her.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;In a moment, as is usually the case, all the shipping in the reach seemed\n      to get into a hopeless tangle. A schooner and a ketch got up a small\n      collision all to themselves right in the middle of the river. It was\n      exciting to watch, and, meantime, our tug remained stopped. Any other ship\n      than that brute could have been coaxed to keep straight for a couple of\n      minutes&mdash;but not she! Her head fell off at once, and she began to\n      drift down, taking her tug along with her. I noticed a cluster of coasters\n      at anchor within a quarter of a mile of us, and I thought I had better\n      speak to the pilot. &lsquo;If you let her get amongst that lot,&rsquo; I said,\n      quietly, &lsquo;she will grind some of them to bits before we get her out\n      again.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t I know her!&rsquo; cries he, stamping his foot in a perfect fury. And he\n      out with his whistle to make that bothered tug get the ship&rsquo;s head up\n      again as quick as possible. He blew like mad, waving his arm to port, and\n      presently we could see that the tug&rsquo;s engines had been set going ahead.\n      Her paddles churned the water, but it was as if she had been trying to tow\n      a rock&mdash;she couldn&rsquo;t get an inch out of that ship. Again the pilot\n      blew his whistle, and waved his arm to port. We could see the tug&rsquo;s\n      paddles turning faster and faster away, broad on our bow.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;For a moment tug and ship hung motionless in a crowd of moving shipping,\n      and then the terrific strain that evil, stony-hearted brute would always\n      put on everything, tore the towing-chock clean out. The tow-rope surged\n      over, snapping the iron stanchions of the head-rail one after another as\n      if they had been sticks of sealing-wax. It was only then I noticed that in\n      order to have a better view over our heads, Maggie had stepped upon the\n      port anchor as it lay flat on the forecastle deck.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It had been lowered properly into its hardwood beds, but there had been\n      no time to take a turn with it. Anyway, it was quite secure as it was, for\n      going into dock; but I could see directly that the tow-rope would sweep\n      under the fluke in another second. My heart flew up right into my throat,\n      but not before I had time to yell out: &lsquo;Jump clear of that anchor!&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;But I hadn&rsquo;t time to shriek out her name. I don&rsquo;t suppose she heard me at\n      all. The first touch of the hawser against the fluke threw her down; she\n      was up on her feet again quick as lightning, but she was up on the wrong\n      side. I heard a horrid, scraping sound, and then that anchor, tipping\n      over, rose up like something alive; its great, rough iron arm caught\n      Maggie round the waist, seemed to clasp her close with a dreadful hug, and\n      flung itself with her over and down in a terrific clang of iron, followed\n      by heavy ringing blows that shook the ship from stem to stern&mdash;because\n      the ring stopper held!&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;How horrible!&rdquo; I exclaimed.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I used to dream for years afterwards of anchors catching hold of girls,&rdquo;\n       said the man in tweeds, a little wildly. He shuddered. &ldquo;With a most\n      pitiful howl Charley was over after her almost on the instant. But, Lord!\n      he didn&rsquo;t see as much as a gleam of her red tam o&rsquo; shanter in the water.\n      Nothing! nothing whatever! In a moment there were half-a-dozen boats\n      around us, and he got pulled into one. I, with the boatswain and the\n      carpenter, let go the other anchor in a hurry and brought the ship up\n      somehow. The pilot had gone silly. He walked up and down the forecastle\n      head wringing his hands and muttering to himself: &lsquo;Killing women, now!\n      Killing women, now!&rsquo; Not another word could you get out of him.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Dusk fell, then a night black as pitch; and peering upon the river I\n      heard a low, mournful hail, &lsquo;Ship, ahoy!&rsquo; Two Gravesend watermen came\n      alongside. They had a lantern in their wherry, and looked up the ship&rsquo;s\n      side, holding on to the ladder without a word. I saw in the patch of light\n      a lot of loose, fair hair down there.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      He shuddered again.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;After the tide turned poor Maggie&rsquo;s body had floated clear of one of them\n      big mooring buoys,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I crept aft, feeling half-dead, and\n      managed to send a rocket up&mdash;to let the other searchers know, on the\n      river. And then I slunk away forward like a cur, and spent the night\n      sitting on the heel of the bowsprit so as to be as far as possible out of\n      Charley&rsquo;s way.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; I murmured.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Yes. Poor fellow,&rdquo; he repeated, musingly. &ldquo;That brute wouldn&rsquo;t let him&mdash;not\n      even him&mdash;cheat her of her prey. But he made her fast in dock next\n      morning. He did. We hadn&rsquo;t exchanged a word&mdash;not a single look for\n      that matter. I didn&rsquo;t want to look at him. When the last rope was fast he\n      put his hands to his head and stood gazing down at his feet as if trying\n      to remember something. The men waited on the main deck for the words that\n      end the voyage. Perhaps that is what he was trying to remember. I spoke\n      for him. &lsquo;That&rsquo;ll do, men.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I never saw a crew leave a ship so quietly. They sneaked over the rail\n      one after another, taking care not to bang their sea chests too heavily.\n      They looked our way, but not one had the stomach to come up and offer to\n      shake hands with the mate as is usual.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I followed him all over the empty ship to and fro, here and there, with\n      no living soul about but the two of us, because the old ship-keeper had\n      locked himself up in the galley&mdash;both doors. Suddenly poor Charley\n      mutters, in a crazy voice: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m done here,&rsquo; and strides down the gangway\n      with me at his heels, up the dock, out at the gate, on towards Tower Hill.\n      He used to take rooms with a decent old landlady in America Square, to be\n      near his work.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;All at once he stops short, turns round, and comes back straight at me.\n      &lsquo;Ned,&rsquo; says he, I am going home.&rsquo; I had the good luck to sight a\n      four-wheeler and got him in just in time. His legs were beginning to give\n      way. In our hall he fell down on a chair, and I&rsquo;ll never forget father&rsquo;s\n      and mother&rsquo;s amazed, perfectly still faces as they stood over him. They\n      couldn&rsquo;t understand what had happened to him till I blubbered out, &lsquo;Maggie\n      got drowned, yesterday, in the river.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Mother let out a little cry. Father looks from him to me, and from me to\n      him, as if comparing our faces&mdash;for, upon my soul, Charley did not\n      resemble himself at all. Nobody moved; and the poor fellow raises his big\n      brown hands slowly to his throat, and with one single tug rips everything\n      open&mdash;collar, shirt, waistcoat&mdash;a perfect wreck and ruin of a\n      man. Father and I got him upstairs somehow, and mother pretty nearly\n      killed herself nursing him through a brain fever.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The man in tweeds nodded at me significantly.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Ah! there was nothing that could be done with that brute. She had a devil\n      in her.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your brother?&rdquo; I asked, expecting to hear he was dead. But he was\n      commanding a smart steamer on the China coast, and never came home now.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Jermyn fetched a heavy sigh, and the handkerchief being now sufficiently\n      dry, put it up tenderly to his red and lamentable nose.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;She was a ravening beast,&rdquo; the man in tweeds started again. &ldquo;Old\n      Colchester put his foot down and resigned. And would you believe it? Apse\n      &amp; Sons wrote to ask whether he wouldn&rsquo;t reconsider his decision!\n      Anything to save the good name of the Apse Family.&rsquo; Old Colchester went to\n      the office then and said that he would take charge again but only to sail\n      her out into the North Sea and scuttle her there. He was nearly off his\n      chump. He used to be darkish iron-grey, but his hair went snow-white in a\n      fortnight. And Mr. Lucian Apse (they had known each other as young men)\n      pretended not to notice it. Eh? Here&rsquo;s infatuation if you like! Here&rsquo;s\n      pride for you!\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;They jumped at the first man they could get to take her, for fear of the\n      scandal of the Apse Family not being able to find a skipper. He was a\n      festive soul, I believe, but he stuck to her grim and hard. Wilmot was his\n      second mate. A harum-scarum fellow, and pretending to a great scorn for\n      all the girls. The fact is he was really timid. But let only one of them\n      do as much as lift her little finger in encouragement, and there was\n      nothing that could hold the beggar. As apprentice, once, he deserted\n      abroad after a petticoat, and would have gone to the dogs then, if his\n      skipper hadn&rsquo;t taken the trouble to find him and lug him by the ears out\n      of some house of perdition or other.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It was said that one of the firm had been heard once to express a hope\n      that this brute of a ship would get lost soon. I can hardly credit the\n      tale, unless it might have been Mr. Alfred Apse, whom the family didn&rsquo;t\n      think much of. They had him in the office, but he was considered a bad egg\n      altogether, always flying off to race meetings and coming home drunk. You\n      would have thought that a ship so full of deadly tricks would run herself\n      ashore some day out of sheer cussedness. But not she! She was going to\n      last for ever. She had a nose to keep off the bottom.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Jermyn made a grunt of approval.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;A ship after a pilot&rsquo;s own heart, eh?&rdquo; jeered the man in tweeds. &ldquo;Well,\n      Wilmot managed it. He was the man for it, but even he, perhaps, couldn&rsquo;t\n      have done the trick without the green-eyed governess, or nurse, or\n      whatever she was to the children of Mr. and Mrs. Pamphilius.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Those people were passengers in her from Port Adelaide to the Cape. Well,\n      the ship went out and anchored outside for the day. The skipper&mdash;hospitable\n      soul&mdash;had a lot of guests from town to a farewell lunch&mdash;as\n      usual with him. It was five in the evening before the last shore boat left\n      the side, and the weather looked ugly and dark in the gulf. There was no\n      reason for him to get under way. However, as he had told everybody he was\n      going that day, he imagined it was proper to do so anyhow. But as he had\n      no mind after all these festivities to tackle the straits in the dark,\n      with a scant wind, he gave orders to keep the ship under lower topsails\n      and foresail as close as she would lie, dodging along the land till the\n      morning. Then he sought his virtuous couch. The mate was on deck, having\n      his face washed very clean with hard rain squalls. Wilmot relieved him at\n      midnight.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The Apse Family had, as you observed, a house on her poop . . .&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;A big, ugly white thing, sticking up,&rdquo; Jermyn murmured, sadly, at the\n      fire.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it: a companion for the cabin stairs and a sort of chart-room\n      combined. The rain drove in gusts on the sleepy Wilmot. The ship was then\n      surging slowly to the southward, close hauled, with the coast within three\n      miles or so to windward. There was nothing to look out for in that part of\n      the gulf, and Wilmot went round to dodge the squalls under the lee of that\n      chart-room, whose door on that side was open. The night was black, like a\n      barrel of coal-tar. And then he heard a woman&rsquo;s voice whispering to him.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;That confounded green-eyed girl of the Pamphilius people had put the kids\n      to bed a long time ago, of course, but it seems couldn&rsquo;t get to sleep\n      herself. She heard eight bells struck, and the chief mate come below to\n      turn in. She waited a bit, then got into her dressing-gown and stole\n      across the empty saloon and up the stairs into the chart-room. She sat\n      down on the settee near the open door to cool herself, I daresay.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I suppose when she whispered to Wilmot it was as if somebody had struck a\n      match in the fellow&rsquo;s brain. I don&rsquo;t know how it was they had got so very\n      thick. I fancy he had met her ashore a few times before. I couldn&rsquo;t make\n      it out, because, when telling the story, Wilmot would break off to swear\n      something awful at every second word. We had met on the quay in Sydney,\n      and he had an apron of sacking up to his chin, a big whip in his hand. A\n      wagon-driver. Glad to do anything not to starve. That&rsquo;s what he had come\n      down to.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;However, there he was, with his head inside the door, on the girl&rsquo;s\n      shoulder as likely as not&mdash;officer of the watch! The helmsman, on\n      giving his evidence afterwards, said that he shouted several times that\n      the binnacle lamp had gone out. It didn&rsquo;t matter to him, because his\n      orders were to &lsquo;sail her close.&rsquo; &lsquo;I thought it funny,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that the\n      ship should keep on falling off in squalls, but I luffed her up every time\n      as close as I was able. It was so dark I couldn&rsquo;t see my hand before my\n      face, and the rain came in bucketfuls on my head.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The truth was that at every squall the wind hauled aft a little, till\n      gradually the ship came to be heading straight for the coast, without a\n      single soul in her being aware of it. Wilmot himself confessed that he had\n      not been near the standard compass for an hour. He might well have\n      confessed! The first thing he knew was the man on the look-out shouting\n      blue murder forward there.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He tore his neck free, he says, and yelled back at him: &lsquo;What do you\n      say?&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;I think I hear breakers ahead, sir,&rsquo; howled the man, and came rushing\n      aft with the rest of the watch, in the &lsquo;awfullest blinding deluge that\n      ever fell from the sky,&rsquo; Wilmot says. For a second or so he was so scared\n      and bewildered that he could not remember on which side of the gulf the\n      ship was. He wasn&rsquo;t a good officer, but he was a seaman all the same. He\n      pulled himself together in a second, and the right orders sprang to his\n      lips without thinking. They were to hard up with the helm and shiver the\n      main and mizzen-topsails.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It seems that the sails actually fluttered. He couldn&rsquo;t see them, but he\n      heard them rattling and banging above his head. &lsquo;No use! She was too slow\n      in going off,&rsquo; he went on, his dirty face twitching, and the damn&rsquo;d\n      carter&rsquo;s whip shaking in his hand. &lsquo;She seemed to stick fast.&rsquo; And then\n      the flutter of the canvas above his head ceased. At this critical moment\n      the wind hauled aft again with a gust, filling the sails and sending the\n      ship with a great way upon the rocks on her lee bow. She had overreached\n      herself in her last little game. Her time had come&mdash;the hour, the\n      man, the black night, the treacherous gust of wind&mdash;the right woman\n      to put an end to her. The brute deserved nothing better. Strange are the\n      instruments of Providence. There&rsquo;s a sort of poetical justice&mdash;&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The man in tweeds looked hard at me.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The first ledge she went over stripped the false keel off her. Rip! The\n      skipper, rushing out of his berth, found a crazy woman, in a red flannel\n      dressing-gown, flying round and round the cuddy, screeching like a\n      cockatoo.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The next bump knocked her clean under the cabin table. It also started\n      the stern-post and carried away the rudder, and then that brute ran up a\n      shelving, rocky shore, tearing her bottom out, till she stopped short, and\n      the foremast dropped over the bows like a gangway.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Anybody lost?&rdquo; I asked.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;No one, unless that fellow, Wilmot,&rdquo; answered the gentleman, unknown to\n      Miss Blank, looking round for his cap. &ldquo;And his case was worse than\n      drowning for a man. Everybody got ashore all right. Gale didn&rsquo;t come on\n      till next day, dead from the West, and broke up that brute in a\n      surprisingly short time. It was as though she had been rotten at heart.&rdquo; .\n      . . He changed his tone, &ldquo;Rain left off? I must get my bike and rush home\n      to dinner. I live in Herne Bay&mdash;came out for a spin this morning.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      He nodded at me in a friendly way, and went out with a swagger.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Do you know who he is, Jermyn?&rdquo; I asked.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The North Sea pilot shook his head, dismally. &ldquo;Fancy losing a ship in that\n      silly fashion! Oh, dear! oh dear!&rdquo; he groaned in lugubrious tones,\n      spreading his damp handkerchief again like a curtain before the glowing\n      grate.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      On going out I exchanged a glance and a smile (strictly proper) with the\n      respectable Miss Blank, barmaid of the Three Crows.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <a name=\"link2H_4_0006\" id=\"link2H_4_0006\">\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\n    </p>\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\n    </div>\n    <h2>\n      AN ANARCHIST\n    </h2>\n    <h3>\n      A DESPERATE TALE\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n      That year I spent the best two months of the dry season on one of the\n      estates&mdash;in fact, on the principal cattle estate&mdash;of a famous\n      meat-extract manufacturing company.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      B.O.S. Bos. You have seen the three magic letters on the advertisement\n      pages of magazines and newspapers, in the windows of provision merchants,\n      and on calendars for next year you receive by post in the month of\n      November. They scatter pamphlets also, written in a sickly enthusiastic\n      style and in several languages, giving statistics of slaughter and\n      bloodshed enough to make a Turk turn faint. The &ldquo;art&rdquo; illustrating that\n      &ldquo;literature&rdquo; represents in vivid and shining colours a large and enraged\n      black bull stamping upon a yellow snake writhing in emerald-green grass,\n      with a cobalt-blue sky for a background. It is atrocious and it is an\n      allegory. The snake symbolizes disease, weakness&mdash;perhaps mere\n      hunger, which last is the chronic disease of the majority of mankind. Of\n      course everybody knows the B. O. S. Ltd., with its unrivalled products:\n      Vinobos, Jellybos, and the latest unequalled perfection, Tribos, whose\n      nourishment is offered to you not only highly concentrated, but already\n      half digested. Such apparently is the love that Limited Company bears to\n      its fellowmen&mdash;even as the love of the father and mother penguin for\n      their hungry fledglings.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Of course the capital of a country must be productively employed. I have\n      nothing to say against the company. But being myself animated by feelings\n      of affection towards my fellow-men, I am saddened by the modern system of\n      advertising. Whatever evidence it offers of enterprise, ingenuity,\n      impudence, and resource in certain individuals, it proves to my mind the\n      wide prevalence of that form of mental degradation which is called\n      gullibility.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In various parts of the civilized and uncivilized world I have had to\n      swallow B. O. S. with more or less benefit to myself, though without great\n      pleasure. Prepared with hot water and abundantly peppered to bring out the\n      taste, this extract is not really unpalatable. But I have never swallowed\n      its advertisements. Perhaps they have not gone far enough. As far as I can\n      remember they make no promise of everlasting youth to the users of B. O.\n      S., nor yet have they claimed the power of raising the dead for their\n      estimable products. Why this austere reserve, I wonder? But I don&rsquo;t think\n      they would have had me even on these terms. Whatever form of mental\n      degradation I may (being but human) be suffering from, it is not the\n      popular form. I am not gullible.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      I have been at some pains to bring out distinctly this statement about\n      myself in view of the story which follows. I have checked the facts as far\n      as possible. I have turned up the files of French newspapers, and I have\n      also talked with the officer who commands the military guard on the Ile\n      Royale, when in the course of my travels I reached Cayenne. I believe the\n      story to be in the main true. It is the sort of story that no man, I\n      think, would ever invent about himself, for it is neither grandiose nor\n      flattering, nor yet funny enough to gratify a perverted vanity.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      It concerns the engineer of the steam-launch belonging to the Maranon\n      cattle estate of the B. O. S. Co., Ltd. This estate is also an island&mdash;an\n      island as big as a small province, lying in the estuary of a great South\n      American river. It is wild and not beautiful, but the grass growing on its\n      low plains seems to possess exceptionally nourishing and flavouring\n      qualities. It resounds with the lowing of innumerable herds&mdash;a deep\n      and distressing sound under the open sky, rising like a monstrous protest\n      of prisoners condemned to death. On the mainland, across twenty miles of\n      discoloured muddy water, there stands a city whose name, let us say, is\n      Horta.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      But the most interesting characteristic of this island (which seems like a\n      sort of penal settlement for condemned cattle) consists in its being the\n      only known habitat of an extremely rare and gorgeous butterfly. The\n      species is even more rare than it is beautiful, which is not saying\n      little. I have already alluded to my travels. I travelled at that time,\n      but strictly for myself and with a moderation unknown in our days of\n      round-the-world tickets. I even travelled with a purpose. As a matter of\n      fact, I am&mdash;&ldquo;Ha, ha, ha!&mdash;a desperate butterfly-slayer. Ha, ha,\n      ha!&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      This was the tone in which Mr. Harry Gee, the manager of the cattle\n      station, alluded to my pursuits. He seemed to consider me the greatest\n      absurdity in the world. On the other hand, the B. O. S. Co., Ltd.,\n      represented to him the acme of the nineteenth century&rsquo;s achievement. I\n      believe that he slept in his leggings and spurs. His days he spent in the\n      saddle flying over the plains, followed by a train of half-wild horsemen,\n      who called him Don Enrique, and who had no definite idea of the B. O. S.\n      Co., Ltd., which paid their wages. He was an excellent manager, but I\n      don&rsquo;t see why, when we met at meals, he should have thumped me on the\n      back, with loud, derisive inquiries: &ldquo;How&rsquo;s the deadly sport to-day?\n      Butterflies going strong? Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;&mdash;especially as he charged me\n      two dollars per diem for the hospitality of the B. O. S. Co., Ltd.,\n      (capital L1,500,000, fully paid up), in whose balance-sheet for that year\n      those monies are no doubt included. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can make it anything\n      less in justice to my company,&rdquo; he had remarked, with extreme gravity,\n      when I was arranging with him the terms of my stay on the island.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      His chaff would have been harmless enough if intimacy of intercourse in\n      the absence of all friendly feeling were not a thing detestable in itself.\n      Moreover, his facetiousness was not very amusing. It consisted in the\n      wearisome repetition of descriptive phrases applied to people with a burst\n      of laughter. &ldquo;Desperate butterfly-slayer. Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo; was one sample of\n      his peculiar wit which he himself enjoyed so much. And in the same vein of\n      exquisite humour he called my attention to the engineer of the\n      steam-launch, one day, as we strolled on the path by the side of the\n      creek.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The man&rsquo;s head and shoulders emerged above the deck, over which were\n      scattered various tools of his trade and a few pieces of machinery. He was\n      doing some repairs to the engines. At the sound of our footsteps he raised\n      anxiously a grimy face with a pointed chin and a tiny fair moustache. What\n      could be seen of his delicate features under the black smudges appeared to\n      me wasted and livid in the greenish shade of the enormous tree spreading\n      its foliage over the launch moored close to the bank.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      To my great surprise, Harry Gee addressed him as &ldquo;Crocodile,&rdquo; in that\n      half-jeering, half-bullying tone which is characteristic of\n      self-satisfaction in his delectable kind:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;How does the work get on, Crocodile?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      I should have said before that the amiable Harry had picked up French of a\n      sort somewhere&mdash;in some colony or other&mdash;and that he pronounced\n      it with a disagreeable forced precision as though he meant to guy the\n      language. The man in the launch answered him quickly in a pleasant voice.\n      His eyes had a liquid softness and his teeth flashed dazzlingly white\n      between his thin, drooping lips. The manager turned to me, very cheerful\n      and loud, explaining:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I call him Crocodile because he lives half in, half out of the creek.\n      Amphibious&mdash;see? There&rsquo;s nothing else amphibious living on the island\n      except crocodiles; so he must belong to the species&mdash;eh? But in\n      reality he&rsquo;s nothing less than un citoyen anarchiste de Barcelone.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;A citizen anarchist from Barcelona?&rdquo; I repeated, stupidly, looking down\n      at the man. He had turned to his work in the engine-well of the launch and\n      presented his bowed back to us. In that attitude I heard him protest, very\n      audibly:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I do not even know Spanish.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Hey? What? You dare to deny you come from over there?&rdquo; the accomplished\n      manager was down on him truculently.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      At this the man straightened himself up, dropping a spanner he had been\n      using, and faced us; but he trembled in all his limbs.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I deny nothing, nothing, nothing!&rdquo; he said, excitedly.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He picked up the spanner and went to work again without paying any further\n      attention to us. After looking at him for a minute or so, we went away.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Is he really an anarchist?&rdquo; I asked, when out of ear-shot.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a hang what he is,&rdquo; answered the humorous official of the B.\n      O. S. Co. &ldquo;I gave him the name because it suited me to label him in that\n      way, It&rsquo;s good for the company.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;For the company!&rdquo; I exclaimed, stopping short.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; he triumphed, tilting up his hairless pug face and straddling his\n      thin, long legs. &ldquo;That surprises you. I am bound to do my best for my\n      company. They have enormous expenses. Why&mdash;our agent in Horta tells\n      me they spend fifty thousand pounds every year in advertising all over the\n      world! One can&rsquo;t be too economical in working the show. Well, just you\n      listen. When I took charge here the estate had no steam-launch. I asked\n      for one, and kept on asking by every mail till I got it; but the man they\n      sent out with it chucked his job at the end of two months, leaving the\n      launch moored at the pontoon in Horta. Got a better screw at a sawmill up\n      the river&mdash;blast him! And ever since it has been the same thing. Any\n      Scotch or Yankee vagabond that likes to call himself a mechanic out here\n      gets eighteen pounds a month, and the next you know he&rsquo;s cleared out,\n      after smashing something as likely as not. I give you my word that some of\n      the objects I&rsquo;ve had for engine-drivers couldn&rsquo;t tell the boiler from the\n      funnel. But this fellow understands his trade, and I don&rsquo;t mean him to\n      clear out. See?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      And he struck me lightly on the chest for emphasis. Disregarding his\n      peculiarities of manner, I wanted to know what all this had to do with the\n      man being an anarchist.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; jeered the manager. &ldquo;If you saw suddenly a barefooted, unkempt\n      chap slinking amongst the bushes on the sea face of the island, and at the\n      same time observed less than a mile from the beach, a small schooner full\n      of niggers hauling off in a hurry, you wouldn&rsquo;t think the man fell there\n      from the sky, would you? And it could be nothing else but either that or\n      Cayenne. I&rsquo;ve got my wits about me. Directly I sighted this queer game I\n      said to myself&mdash;&lsquo;Escaped Convict.&rsquo; I was as certain of it as I am of\n      seeing you standing here this minute. So I spurred on straight at him. He\n      stood his ground for a bit on a sand hillock crying out: &lsquo;Monsieur!\n      Monsieur! Arretez!&rsquo; then at the last moment broke and ran for life. Says I\n      to myself, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tame you before I&rsquo;m done with you.&rsquo; So without a single\n      word I kept on, heading him off here and there. I rounded him up towards\n      the shore, and at last I had him corralled on a spit, his heels in the\n      water and nothing but sea and sky at his back, with my horse pawing the\n      sand and shaking his head within a yard of him.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He folded his arms on his breast then and stuck his chin up in a sort of\n      desperate way; but I wasn&rsquo;t to be impressed by the beggar&rsquo;s posturing.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Says I, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a runaway convict.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;When he heard French, his chin went down and his face changed.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;I deny nothing,&rsquo; says he, panting yet, for I had kept him skipping about\n      in front of my horse pretty smartly. I asked him what he was doing there.\n      He had got his breath by then, and explained that he had meant to make his\n      way to a farm which he understood (from the schooner&rsquo;s people, I suppose)\n      was to be found in the neighbourhood. At that I laughed aloud and he got\n      uneasy. Had he been deceived? Was there no farm within walking distance?\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I laughed more and more. He was on foot, and of course the first bunch of\n      cattle he came across would have stamped him to rags under their hoofs. A\n      dismounted man caught on the feeding-grounds hasn&rsquo;t got the ghost of a\n      chance.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;My coming upon you like this has certainly saved your life,&rsquo; I said. He\n      remarked that perhaps it was so; but that for his part he had imagined I\n      had wanted to kill him under the hoofs of my horse. I assured him that\n      nothing would have been easier had I meant it. And then we came to a sort\n      of dead stop. For the life of me I didn&rsquo;t know what to do with this\n      convict, unless I chucked him into the sea. It occurred to me to ask him\n      what he had been transported for. He hung his head.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Theft, murder, rape, or what?&rsquo; I wanted to hear\n      what he would have to say for himself, though of course I expected it\n      would be some sort of lie. But all he said was&mdash;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Make it what you like. I deny nothing. It is no good denying anything.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I looked him over carefully and a thought struck me.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;They&rsquo;ve got anarchists there, too,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re one of\n      them.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;I deny nothing whatever, monsieur,&rsquo; he repeats.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;This answer made me think that perhaps he was not an anarchist. I believe\n      those damned lunatics are rather proud of themselves. If he had been one,\n      he would have probably confessed straight out.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;What were you before you became a convict?&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ouvrier,&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;And a good workman, too.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;At that I began to think he must be an anarchist, after all. That&rsquo;s the\n      class they come mostly from, isn&rsquo;t it? I hate the cowardly bomb-throwing\n      brutes. I almost made up my mind to turn my horse short round and leave\n      him to starve or drown where he was, whichever he liked best. As to\n      crossing the island to bother me again, the cattle would see to that. I\n      don&rsquo;t know what induced me to ask&mdash;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;What sort of workman?&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t care a hang whether he answered me or not. But when he said at\n      once, &lsquo;Mecanicien, monsieur,&rsquo; I nearly jumped out of the saddle with\n      excitement. The launch had been lying disabled and idle in the creek for\n      three weeks. My duty to the company was clear. He noticed my start, too,\n      and there we were for a minute or so staring at each other as if\n      bewitched.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Get up on my horse behind me,&rsquo; I told him. &lsquo;You shall put my\n      steam-launch to rights.&rsquo;&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      These are the words in which the worthy manager of the Maranon estate\n      related to me the coming of the supposed anarchist. He meant to keep him&mdash;out\n      of a sense of duty to the company&mdash;and the name he had given him\n      would prevent the fellow from obtaining employment anywhere in Horta. The\n      vaqueros of the estate, when they went on leave, spread it all over the\n      town. They did not know what an anarchist was, nor yet what Barcelona\n      meant. They called him Anarchisto de Barcelona, as if it were his\n      Christian name and surname. But the people in town had been reading in\n      their papers about the anarchists in Europe and were very much impressed.\n      Over the jocular addition of &ldquo;de Barcelona&rdquo; Mr. Harry Gee chuckled with\n      immense satisfaction. &ldquo;That breed is particularly murderous, isn&rsquo;t it? It\n      makes the sawmills crowd still more afraid of having anything to do with\n      him&mdash;see?&rdquo; he exulted, candidly. &ldquo;I hold him by that name better than\n      if I had him chained up by the leg to the deck of the steam-launch.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;And mark,&rdquo; he added, after a pause, &ldquo;he does not deny it. I am not\n      wronging him in any way. He is a convict of some sort, anyhow.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;But I suppose you pay him some wages, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; I asked.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Wages! What does he want with money here? He gets his food from my\n      kitchen and his clothing from the store. Of course I&rsquo;ll give him something\n      at the end of the year, but you don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d employ a convict and give\n      him the same money I would give an honest man? I am looking after the\n      interests of my company first and last.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      I admitted that, for a company spending fifty thousand pounds every year\n      in advertising, the strictest economy was obviously necessary. The manager\n      of the Maranon Estancia grunted approvingly.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rdquo; he continued: &ldquo;if I were certain he&rsquo;s an\n      anarchist and he had the cheek to ask me for money, I would give him the\n      toe of my boot. However, let him have the benefit of the doubt. I am\n      perfectly willing to take it that he has done nothing worse than to stick\n      a knife into somebody&mdash;with extenuating circumstances&mdash;French\n      fashion, don&rsquo;t you know. But that subversive sanguinary rot of doing away\n      with all law and order in the world makes my blood boil. It&rsquo;s simply\n      cutting the ground from under the feet of every decent, respectable,\n      hard-working person. I tell you that the consciences of people who have\n      them, like you or I, must be protected in some way; or else the first low\n      scoundrel that came along would in every respect be just as good as\n      myself. Wouldn&rsquo;t he, now? And that&rsquo;s absurd!&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      He glared at me. I nodded slightly and murmured that doubtless there was\n      much subtle truth in his view.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The principal truth discoverable in the views of Paul the engineer was\n      that a little thing may bring about the undoing of a man.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;<i>Il ne faut pas beaucoup pour perdre un homme</i>,&rdquo; he said to me,\n      thoughtfully, one evening.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      I report this reflection in French, since the man was of Paris, not of\n      Barcelona at all. At the Maranon he lived apart from the station, in a\n      small shed with a metal roof and straw walls, which he called mon atelier.\n      He had a work-bench there. They had given him several horse-blankets and a\n      saddle&mdash;not that he ever had occasion to ride, but because no other\n      bedding was used by the working-hands, who were all vaqueros&mdash;cattlemen.\n      And on this horseman&rsquo;s gear, like a son of the plains, he used to sleep\n      amongst the tools of his trade, in a litter of rusty scrap-iron, with a\n      portable forge at his head, under the work-bench sustaining his grimy\n      mosquito-net.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Now and then I would bring him a few candle ends saved from the scant\n      supply of the manager&rsquo;s house. He was very thankful for these. He did not\n      like to lie awake in the dark, he confessed. He complained that sleep fled\n      from him. &ldquo;Le sommeil me fuit,&rdquo; he declared, with his habitual air of\n      subdued stoicism, which made him sympathetic and touching. I made it clear\n      to him that I did not attach undue importance to the fact of his having\n      been a convict.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Thus it came about that one evening he was led to talk about himself. As\n      one of the bits of candle on the edge of the bench burned down to the end,\n      he hastened to light another.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He had done his military service in a provincial garrison and returned to\n      Paris to follow his trade. It was a well-paid one. He told me with some\n      pride that in a short time he was earning no less than ten francs a day.\n      He was thinking of setting up for himself by and by and of getting\n      married.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Here he sighed deeply and paused. Then with a return to his stoical note:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It seems I did not know enough about myself.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      On his twenty-fifth birthday two of his friends in the repairing shop\n      where he worked proposed to stand him a dinner. He was immensely touched\n      by this attention.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I was a steady man,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;but I am not less sociable than any\n      other body.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The entertainment came off in a little cafe on the Boulevard de la\n      Chapelle. At dinner they drank some special wine. It was excellent.\n      Everything was excellent; and the world&mdash;in his own words&mdash;seemed\n      a very good place to live in. He had good prospects, some little money\n      laid by, and the affection of two excellent friends. He offered to pay for\n      all the drinks after dinner, which was only proper on his part.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      They drank more wine; they drank liqueurs, cognac, beer, then more\n      liqueurs and more cognac. Two strangers sitting at the next table looked\n      at him, he said, with so much friendliness, that he invited them to join\n      the party.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He had never drunk so much in his life. His elation was extreme, and so\n      pleasurable that whenever it flagged he hastened to order more drinks.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It seemed to me,&rdquo; he said, in his quiet tone and looking on the ground in\n      the gloomy shed full of shadows, &ldquo;that I was on the point of just\n      attaining a great and wonderful felicity. Another drink, I felt, would do\n      it. The others were holding out well with me, glass for glass.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      But an extraordinary thing happened. At something the strangers said his\n      elation fell. Gloomy ideas&mdash;des idees noires&mdash;rushed into his\n      head. All the world outside the cafe; appeared to him as a dismal evil\n      place where a multitude of poor wretches had to work and slave to the sole\n      end that a few individuals should ride in carriages and live riotously in\n      palaces. He became ashamed of his happiness. The pity of mankind&rsquo;s cruel\n      lot wrung his heart. In a voice choked with sorrow he tried to express\n      these sentiments. He thinks he wept and swore in turns.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The two new acquaintances hastened to applaud his humane indignation. Yes.\n      The amount of injustice in the world was indeed scandalous. There was only\n      one way of dealing with the rotten state of society. Demolish the whole\n      sacree boutique. Blow up the whole iniquitous show.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Their heads hovered over the table. They whispered to him eloquently; I\n      don&rsquo;t think they quite expected the result. He was extremely drunk&mdash;mad\n      drunk. With a howl of rage he leaped suddenly upon the table. Kicking over\n      the bottles and glasses, he yelled: &ldquo;Vive l&rsquo;anarchie! Death to the\n      capitalists!&rdquo; He yelled this again and again. All round him broken glass\n      was falling, chairs were being swung in the air, people were taking each\n      other by the throat. The police dashed in. He hit, bit, scratched and\n      struggled, till something crashed down upon his head. . . .\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He came to himself in a police cell, locked up on a charge of assault,\n      seditious cries, and anarchist propaganda.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He looked at me fixedly with his liquid, shining eyes, that seemed very\n      big in the dim light.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;That was bad. But even then I might have got off somehow, perhaps,&rdquo; he\n      said, slowly.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      I doubt it. But whatever chance he had was done away with by a young\n      socialist lawyer who volunteered to undertake his defence. In vain he\n      assured him that he was no anarchist; that he was a quiet, respectable\n      mechanic, only too anxious to work ten hours per day at his trade. He was\n      represented at the trial as the victim of society and his drunken\n      shoutings as the expression of infinite suffering. The young lawyer had\n      his way to make, and this case was just what he wanted for a start. The\n      speech for the defence was pronounced magnificent.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The poor fellow paused, swallowed, and brought out the statement:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I got the maximum penalty applicable to a first offence.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      I made an appropriate murmur. He hung his head and folded his arms.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;When they let me out of prison,&rdquo; he began, gently, &ldquo;I made tracks, of\n      course, for my old workshop. My patron had a particular liking for me\n      before; but when he saw me he turned green with fright and showed me the\n      door with a shaking hand.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      While he stood in the street, uneasy and disconcerted, he was accosted by\n      a middle-aged man who introduced himself as an engineer&rsquo;s fitter, too. &ldquo;I\n      know who you are,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have attended your trial. You are a good\n      comrade and your ideas are sound. But the devil of it is that you won&rsquo;t be\n      able to get work anywhere now. These bourgeois&rsquo;ll conspire to starve you.\n      That&rsquo;s their way. Expect no mercy from the rich.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      To be spoken to so kindly in the street had comforted him very much. His\n      seemed to be the sort of nature needing support and sympathy. The idea of\n      not being able to find work had knocked him over completely. If his\n      patron, who knew him so well for a quiet, orderly, competent workman,\n      would have nothing to do with him now&mdash;then surely nobody else would.\n      That was clear. The police, keeping their eye on him, would hasten to warn\n      every employer inclined to give him a chance. He felt suddenly very\n      helpless, alarmed and idle; and he followed the middle-aged man to the\n      estaminet round the corner where he met some other good companions. They\n      assured him that he would not be allowed to starve, work or no work. They\n      had drinks all round to the discomfiture of all employers of labour and to\n      the destruction of society.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He sat biting his lower lip.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;That is, monsieur, how I became a compagnon,&rdquo; he said. The hand he passed\n      over his forehead was trembling. &ldquo;All the same, there&rsquo;s something wrong in\n      a world where a man can get lost for a glass more or less.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      He never looked up, though I could see he was getting excited under his\n      dejection. He slapped the bench with his open palm.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;It was an impossible existence! Watched by the police,\n      watched by the comrades, I did not belong to myself any more! Why, I could\n      not even go to draw a few francs from my savings-bank without a comrade\n      hanging about the door to see that I didn&rsquo;t bolt! And most of them were\n      neither more nor less than housebreakers. The intelligent, I mean. They\n      robbed the rich; they were only getting back their own, they said. When I\n      had had some drink I believed them. There were also the fools and the mad.\n      Des exaltes&mdash;quoi! When I was drunk I loved them. When I got more\n      drink I was angry with the world. That was the best time. I found refuge\n      from misery in rage. But one can&rsquo;t be always drunk&mdash;n&rsquo;est-ce pas,\n      monsieur? And when I was sober I was afraid to break away. They would have\n      stuck me like a pig.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      He folded his arms again and raised his sharp chin with a bitter smile.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;By and by they told me it was time to go to work. The work was to rob a\n      bank. Afterwards a bomb would be thrown to wreck the place. My beginner&rsquo;s\n      part would be to keep watch in a street at the back and to take care of a\n      black bag with the bomb inside till it was wanted. After the meeting at\n      which the affair was arranged a trusty comrade did not leave me an inch. I\n      had not dared to protest; I was afraid of being done away with quietly in\n      that room; only, as we were walking together I wondered whether it would\n      not be better for me to throw myself suddenly into the Seine. But while I\n      was turning it over in my mind we had crossed the bridge, and afterwards I\n      had not the opportunity.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      In the light of the candle end, with his sharp features, fluffy little\n      moustache, and oval face, he looked at times delicately and gaily young,\n      and then appeared quite old, decrepit, full of sorrow, pressing his folded\n      arms to his breast.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      As he remained silent I felt bound to ask:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Well! And how did it end?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Deportation to Cayenne,&rdquo; he answered.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He seemed to think that somebody had given the plot away. As he was\n      keeping watch in the back street, bag in hand, he was set upon by the\n      police. &ldquo;These imbeciles,&rdquo; had knocked him down without noticing what he\n      had in his hand. He wondered how the bomb failed to explode as he fell.\n      But it didn&rsquo;t explode.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I tried to tell my story in court,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;The president was\n      amused. There were in the audience some idiots who laughed.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      I expressed the hope that some of his companions had been caught, too. He\n      shuddered slightly before he told me that there were two&mdash;Simon,\n      called also Biscuit, the middle-aged fitter who spoke to him in the\n      street, and a fellow of the name of Mafile, one of the sympathetic\n      strangers who had applauded his sentiments and consoled his humanitarian\n      sorrows when he got drunk in the cafe.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he went on, with an effort, &ldquo;I had the advantage of their company\n      over there on St. Joseph&rsquo;s Island, amongst some eighty or ninety other\n      convicts. We were all classed as dangerous.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      St. Joseph&rsquo;s Island is the prettiest of the Iles de Salut. It is rocky and\n      green, with shallow ravines, bushes, thickets, groves of mango-trees, and\n      many feathery palms. Six warders armed with revolvers and carbines are in\n      charge of the convicts kept there.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      An eight-oared galley keeps up the communication in the daytime, across a\n      channel a quarter of a mile wide, with the Ile Royale, where there is a\n      military post. She makes the first trip at six in the morning. At four in\n      the afternoon her service is over, and she is then hauled up into a little\n      dock on the Ile Royale and a sentry put over her and a few smaller boats.\n      From that time till next morning the island of St. Joseph remains cut off\n      from the rest of the world, with the warders patrolling in turn the path\n      from the warders&rsquo; house to the convict huts, and a multitude of sharks\n      patrolling the waters all round.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Under these circumstances the convicts planned a mutiny. Such a thing had\n      never been known in the penitentiary&rsquo;s history before. But their plan was\n      not without some possibility of success. The warders were to be taken by\n      surprise and murdered during the night. Their arms would enable the\n      convicts to shoot down the people in the galley as she came alongside in\n      the morning. The galley once in their possession, other boats were to be\n      captured, and the whole company was to row away up the coast.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      At dusk the two warders on duty mustered the convicts as usual. Then they\n      proceeded to inspect the huts to ascertain that everything was in order.\n      In the second they entered they were set upon and absolutely smothered\n      under the numbers of their assailants. The twilight faded rapidly. It was\n      a new moon; and a heavy black squall gathering over the coast increased\n      the profound darkness of the night. The convicts assembled in the open\n      space, deliberating upon the next step to be taken, argued amongst\n      themselves in low voices.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;You took part in all this?&rdquo; I asked.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;No. I knew what was going to be done, of course. But why should I kill\n      these warders? I had nothing against them. But I was afraid of the others.\n      Whatever happened, I could not escape from them. I sat alone on the stump\n      of a tree with my head in my hands, sick at heart at the thought of a\n      freedom that could be nothing but a mockery to me. Suddenly I was startled\n      to perceive the shape of a man on the path near by. He stood perfectly\n      still, then his form became effaced in the night. It must have been the\n      chief warder coming to see what had become of his two men. No one noticed\n      him. The convicts kept on quarrelling over their plans. The leaders could\n      not get themselves obeyed. The fierce whispering of that dark mass of men\n      was very horrible.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;At last they divided into two parties and moved off. When they had passed\n      me I rose, weary and hopeless. The path to the warders&rsquo; house was dark and\n      silent, but on each side the bushes rustled slightly. Presently I saw a\n      faint thread of light before me. The chief warder, followed by his three\n      men, was approaching cautiously. But he had failed to close his dark\n      lantern properly. The convicts had seen that faint gleam, too. There was\n      an awful savage yell, a turmoil on the dark path, shots fired, blows,\n      groans: and with the sound of smashed bushes, the shouts of the pursuers\n      and the screams of the pursued, the man-hunt, the warder-hunt, passed by\n      me into the interior of the island. I was alone. And I assure you,\n      monsieur, I was indifferent to everything. After standing still for a\n      while, I walked on along the path till I kicked something hard. I stooped\n      and picked up a warder&rsquo;s revolver. I felt with my fingers that it was\n      loaded in five chambers. In the gusts of wind I heard the convicts calling\n      to each other far away, and then a roll of thunder would cover the\n      soughing and rustling of the trees. Suddenly, a big light ran across my\n      path very low along the ground. And it showed a woman&rsquo;s skirt with the\n      edge of an apron.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I knew that the person who carried it must be the wife of the head\n      warder. They had forgotten all about her, it seems. A shot rang out in the\n      interior of the island, and she cried out to herself as she ran. She\n      passed on. I followed, and presently I saw her again. She was pulling at\n      the cord of the big bell which hangs at the end of the landing-pier, with\n      one hand, and with the other she was swinging the heavy lantern to and\n      fro. This is the agreed signal for the Ile Royale should assistance be\n      required at night. The wind carried the sound away from our island and the\n      light she swung was hidden on the shore side by the few trees that grow\n      near the warders&rsquo; house.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I came up quite close to her from behind. She went on without stopping,\n      without looking aside, as though she had been all alone on the island. A\n      brave woman, monsieur. I put the revolver inside the breast of my blue\n      blouse and waited. A flash of lightning and a clap of thunder destroyed\n      both the sound and the light of the signal for an instant, but she never\n      faltered, pulling at the cord and swinging the lantern as regularly as a\n      machine. She was a comely woman of thirty&mdash;no more. I thought to\n      myself, &lsquo;All that&rsquo;s no good on a night like this.&rsquo; And I made up my mind\n      that if a body of my fellow-convicts came down to the pier&mdash;which was\n      sure to happen soon&mdash;I would shoot her through the head before I shot\n      myself. I knew the &lsquo;comrades&rsquo; well. This idea of mine gave me quite an\n      interest in life, monsieur; and at once, instead of remaining stupidly\n      exposed on the pier, I retreated a little way and crouched behind a bush.\n      I did not intend to let myself be pounced upon unawares and be prevented\n      perhaps from rendering a supreme service to at least one human creature\n      before I died myself.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;But we must believe the signal was seen, for the galley from Ile Royale\n      came over in an astonishingly short time. The woman kept right on till the\n      light of her lantern flashed upon the officer in command and the bayonets\n      of the soldiers in the boat. Then she sat down and began to cry.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t need me any more. I did not budge. Some soldiers were only in\n      their shirt-sleeves, others without boots, just as the call to arms had\n      found them. They passed by my bush at the double. The galley had been sent\n      away for more; and the woman sat all alone crying at the end of the pier,\n      with the lantern standing on the ground near her.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Then suddenly I saw in the light at the end of the pier the red\n      pantaloons of two more men. I was overcome with astonishment. They, too,\n      started off at a run. Their tunics flapped unbuttoned and they were\n      bare-headed. One of them panted out to the other, &lsquo;Straight on, straight\n      on!&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Where on earth did they spring from, I wondered. Slowly I walked down the\n      short pier. I saw the woman&rsquo;s form shaken by sobs and heard her moaning\n      more and more distinctly, &lsquo;Oh, my man! my poor man! my poor man!&rsquo; I stole\n      on quietly. She could neither hear nor see anything. She had thrown her\n      apron over her head and was rocking herself to and fro in her grief. But I\n      remarked a small boat fastened to the end of the pier.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Those two men&mdash;they looked like sous-officiers&mdash;must have come\n      in it, after being too late, I suppose, for the galley. It is incredible\n      that they should have thus broken the regulations from a sense of duty.\n      And it was a stupid thing to do. I could not believe my eyes in the very\n      moment I was stepping into that boat.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I pulled along the shore slowly. A black cloud hung over the Iles de\n      Salut. I heard firing, shouts. Another hunt had begun&mdash;the\n      convict-hunt. The oars were too long to pull comfortably. I managed them\n      with difficulty, though the boat herself was light. But when I got round\n      to the other side of the island the squall broke in rain and wind. I was\n      unable to make head against it. I let the boat drift ashore and secured\n      her.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I knew the spot. There was a tumbledown old hovel standing near the\n      water. Cowering in there I heard through the noises of the wind and the\n      falling downpour some people tearing through the bushes. They came out on\n      the strand. Soldiers perhaps. A flash of lightning threw everything near\n      me into violent relief. Two convicts!\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;And directly an amazed voice exclaimed. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a miracle!&rsquo; It was the\n      voice of Simon, otherwise Biscuit.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;And another voice growled, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s a miracle?&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Why, there&rsquo;s a boat lying here!&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;You must be mad, Simon! But there is, after all. . . . A boat.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;They seemed awed into complete silence. The other man was Mafile. He\n      spoke again, cautiously.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;It is fastened up. There must be somebody here.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I spoke to them from within the hovel: &lsquo;I am here.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;They came in then, and soon gave me to understand that the boat was\n      theirs, not mine. &lsquo;There are two of us,&rsquo; said Mafile, &lsquo;against you alone.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I got out into the open to keep clear of them for fear of getting a\n      treacherous blow on the head. I could have shot them both where they\n      stood. But I said nothing. I kept down the laughter rising in my throat. I\n      made myself very humble and begged to be allowed to go. They consulted in\n      low tones about my fate, while with my hand on the revolver in the bosom\n      of my blouse I had their lives in my power. I let them live. I meant them\n      to pull that boat. I represented to them with abject humility that I\n      understood the management of a boat, and that, being three to pull, we\n      could get a rest in turns. That decided them at last. It was time. A\n      little more and I would have gone into screaming fits at the drollness of\n      it.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      At this point his excitement broke out. He jumped off the bench and\n      gesticulated. The great shadows of his arms darting over roof and walls\n      made the shed appear too small to contain his agitation.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I deny nothing,&rdquo; he burst out. &ldquo;I was elated, monsieur. I tasted a sort\n      of felicity. But I kept very quiet. I took my turns at pulling all through\n      the night. We made for the open sea, putting our trust in a passing ship.\n      It was a foolhardy action. I persuaded them to it. When the sun rose the\n      immensity of water was calm, and the Iles de Salut appeared only like dark\n      specks from the top of each swell. I was steering then. Mafile, who was\n      pulling bow, let out an oath and said, &lsquo;We must rest.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The time to laugh had come at last. And I took my fill of it, I can tell\n      you. I held my sides and rolled in my seat, they had such startled faces.\n      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s got into him, the animal?&rsquo; cries Mafile.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;And Simon, who was nearest to me, says over his shoulder to him, &lsquo;Devil\n      take me if I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s gone mad!&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Then I produced the revolver. Aha! In a moment they both got the stoniest\n      eyes you can imagine. Ha, ha! They were frightened. But they pulled. Oh,\n      yes, they pulled all day, sometimes looking wild and sometimes looking\n      faint. I lost nothing of it because I had to keep my eyes on them all the\n      time, or else&mdash;crack!&mdash;they would have been on top of me in a\n      second. I rested my revolver hand on my knee all ready and steered with\n      the other. Their faces began to blister. Sky and sea seemed on fire round\n      us and the sea steamed in the sun. The boat made a sizzling sound as she\n      went through the water. Sometimes Mafile foamed at the mouth and sometimes\n      he groaned. But he pulled. He dared not stop. His eyes became blood-shot\n      all over, and he had bitten his lower lip to pieces. Simon was as hoarse\n      as a crow.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Comrade&mdash;&rsquo; he begins.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;There are no comrades here. I am your patron.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Patron, then,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;in the name of humanity let us rest.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I let them. There was a little rainwater washing about the bottom of the\n      boat. I permitted them to snatch some of it in the hollow of their palms.\n      But as I gave the command, &lsquo;En route!&rsquo; I caught them exchanging\n      significant glances. They thought I would have to go to sleep sometime!\n      Aha! But I did not want to go to sleep. I was more awake than ever. It is\n      they who went to sleep as they pulled, tumbling off the thwarts head over\n      heels suddenly, one after another. I let them lie. All the stars were out.\n      It was a quiet world. The sun rose. Another day. Allez! En route!\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;They pulled badly. Their eyes rolled about and their tongues hung out. In\n      the middle of the forenoon Mafile croaks out: &lsquo;Let us make a rush at him,\n      Simon. I would just as soon be shot at once as to die of thirst, hunger,\n      and fatigue at the oar.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;But while he spoke he pulled; and Simon kept on pulling too. It made me\n      smile. Ah! They loved their life these two, in this evil world of theirs,\n      just as I used to love my life, too, before they spoiled it for me with\n      their phrases. I let them go on to the point of exhaustion, and only then\n      I pointed at the sails of a ship on the horizon.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Aha! You should have seen them revive and buckle to their work! For I\n      kept them at it to pull right across that ship&rsquo;s path. They were changed.\n      The sort of pity I had felt for them left me. They looked more like\n      themselves every minute. They looked at me with the glances I remembered\n      so well. They were happy. They smiled.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; says Simon, &lsquo;the energy of that youngster has saved our lives. If\n      he hadn&rsquo;t made us, we could never have pulled so far out into the track of\n      ships. Comrade, I forgive you. I admire you.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;And Mafile growls from forward: &lsquo;We owe you a famous debt of gratitude,\n      comrade. You are cut out for a chief.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Comrade! Monsieur! Ah, what a good word! And they, such men as these two,\n      had made it accursed. I looked at them. I remembered their lies, their\n      promises, their menaces, and all my days of misery. Why could they not\n      have left me alone after I came out of prison? I looked at them and\n      thought that while they lived I could never be free. Never. Neither I nor\n      others like me with warm hearts and weak heads. For I know I have not a\n      strong head, monsieur. A black rage came upon me&mdash;the rage of extreme\n      intoxication&mdash;but not against the injustice of society. Oh, no!\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;I must be free!&rsquo; I cried, furiously.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Vive la liberte!&rdquo; yells that ruffian Mafile. &lsquo;Mort aux bourgeois who\n      send us to Cayenne! They shall soon know that we are free.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The sky, the sea, the whole horizon, seemed to turn red, blood red all\n      round the boat. My temples were beating so loud that I wondered they did\n      not hear. How is it that they did not? How is it they did not understand?\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I heard Simon ask, &lsquo;Have we not pulled far enough out now?&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes. Far enough,&rsquo; I said. I was sorry for him; it was the other I hated.\n      He hauled in his oar with a loud sigh, and as he was raising his hand to\n      wipe his forehead with the air of a man who has done his work, I pulled\n      the trigger of my revolver and shot him like this off the knee, right\n      through the heart.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He tumbled down, with his head hanging over the side of the boat. I did\n      not give him a second glance. The other cried out piercingly. Only one\n      shriek of horror. Then all was still.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He slipped off the thwart on to his knees and raised his clasped hands\n      before his face in an attitude of supplication. &lsquo;Mercy,&rsquo; he whispered,\n      faintly. &lsquo;Mercy for me!&mdash;comrade.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, comrade,&rsquo; I said, in a low tone. &lsquo;Yes, comrade, of course. Well,\n      then, shout Vive l&rsquo;anarchie.&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He flung up his arms, his face up to the sky and his mouth wide open in a\n      great yell of despair. &lsquo;Vive l&rsquo;anarchie! Vive&mdash;&rsquo; \n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He collapsed all in a heap, with a bullet through his head.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I flung them both overboard. I threw away the revolver, too. Then I sat\n      down quietly. I was free at last! At last. I did not even look towards the\n      ship; I did not care; indeed, I think I must have gone to sleep, because\n      all of a sudden there were shouts and I found the ship almost on top of\n      me. They hauled me on board and secured the boat astern. They were all\n      blacks, except the captain, who was a mulatto. He alone knew a few words\n      of French. I could not find out where they were going nor who they were.\n      They gave me something to eat every day; but I did not like the way they\n      used to discuss me in their language. Perhaps they were deliberating about\n      throwing me overboard in order to keep possession of the boat. How do I\n      know? As we were passing this island I asked whether it was inhabited. I\n      understood from the mulatto that there was a house on it. A farm, I\n      fancied, they meant. So I asked them to put me ashore on the beach and\n      keep the boat for their trouble. This, I imagine, was just what they\n      wanted. The rest you know.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      After pronouncing these words he lost suddenly all control over himself.\n      He paced to and fro rapidly, till at last he broke into a run; his arms\n      went like a windmill and his ejaculations became very much like raving.\n      The burden of them was that he &ldquo;denied nothing, nothing!&rdquo; I could only let\n      him go on, and sat out of his way, repeating, &ldquo;Calmez vous, calmez vous,&rdquo;\n       at intervals, till his agitation exhausted itself.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      I must confess, too, that I remained there long after he had crawled under\n      his mosquito-net. He had entreated me not to leave him; so, as one sits up\n      with a nervous child, I sat up with him&mdash;in the name of humanity&mdash;till\n      he fell asleep.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      On the whole, my idea is that he was much more of an anarchist than he\n      confessed to me or to himself; and that, the special features of his case\n      apart, he was very much like many other anarchists. Warm heart and weak\n      head&mdash;that is the word of the riddle; and it is a fact that the\n      bitterest contradictions and the deadliest conflicts of the world are\n      carried on in every individual breast capable of feeling and passion.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      From personal inquiry I can vouch that the story of the convict mutiny was\n      in every particular as stated by him.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      When I got back to Horta from Cayenne and saw the &ldquo;Anarchist&rdquo; again, he\n      did not look well. He was more worn, still more frail, and very livid\n      indeed under the grimy smudges of his calling. Evidently the meat of the\n      company&rsquo;s main herd (in its unconcentrated form) did not agree with him at\n      all.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      It was on the pontoon in Horta that we met; and I tried to induce him to\n      leave the launch moored where she was and follow me to Europe there and\n      then. It would have been delightful to think of the excellent manager&rsquo;s\n      surprise and disgust at the poor fellow&rsquo;s escape. But he refused with\n      unconquerable obstinacy.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Surely you don&rsquo;t mean to live always here!&rdquo; I cried. He shook his head.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I shall die here,&rdquo; he said. Then added moodily, &ldquo;Away from them.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Sometimes I think of him lying open-eyed on his horseman&rsquo;s gear in the low\n      shed full of tools and scraps of iron&mdash;the anarchist slave of the\n      Maranon estate, waiting with resignation for that sleep which &ldquo;fled&rdquo; from\n      him, as he used to say, in such an unaccountable manner.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <a name=\"link2H_4_0007\" id=\"link2H_4_0007\">\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\n    </p>\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\n    </div>\n    <h2>\n      THE DUEL\n    </h2>\n    <h3>\n      A MILITARY TALE\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n      I\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Napoleon I., whose career had the quality of a duel against the whole of\n      Europe, disliked duelling between the officers of his army. The great\n      military emperor was not a swashbuckler, and had little respect for\n      tradition.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Nevertheless, a story of duelling, which became a legend in the army, runs\n      through the epic of imperial wars. To the surprise and admiration of their\n      fellows, two officers, like insane artists trying to gild refined gold or\n      paint the lily, pursued a private contest through the years of universal\n      carnage. They were officers of cavalry, and their connection with the\n      high-spirited but fanciful animal which carries men into battle seems\n      particularly appropriate. It would be difficult to imagine for heroes of\n      this legend two officers of infantry of the line, for example, whose\n      fantasy is tamed by much walking exercise, and whose valour necessarily\n      must be of a more plodding kind. As to gunners or engineers, whose heads\n      are kept cool on a diet of mathematics, it is simply unthinkable.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The names of the two officers were Feraud and D&rsquo;Hubert, and they were both\n      lieutenants in a regiment of hussars, but not in the same regiment.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Feraud was doing regimental work, but Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert had the good fortune\n      to be attached to the person of the general commanding the division, as\n      officier d&rsquo;ordonnance. It was in Strasbourg, and in this agreeable and\n      important garrison they were enjoying greatly a short interval of peace.\n      They were enjoying it, though both intensely warlike, because it was a\n      sword-sharpening, firelock-cleaning peace, dear to a military heart and\n      undamaging to military prestige, inasmuch that no one believed in its\n      sincerity or duration.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Under those historical circumstances, so favourable to the proper\n      appreciation of military leisure, Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert, one fine afternoon,\n      made his way along a quiet street of a cheerful suburb towards Lieut.\n      Feraud&rsquo;s quarters, which were in a private house with a garden at the\n      back, belonging to an old maiden lady.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      His knock at the door was answered instantly by a young maid in Alsatian\n      costume. Her fresh complexion and her long eyelashes, lowered demurely at\n      the sight of the tall officer, caused Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert, who was accessible\n      to esthetic impressions, to relax the cold, severe gravity of his face. At\n      the same time he observed that the girl had over her arm a pair of\n      hussar&rsquo;s breeches, blue with a red stripe.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Lieut. Feraud in?&rdquo; he inquired, benevolently.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Oh, no, sir! He went out at six this morning.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The pretty maid tried to close the door. Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert, opposing this\n      move with gentle firmness, stepped into the ante-room, jingling his spurs.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Come, my dear! You don&rsquo;t mean to say he has not been home since six\n      o&rsquo;clock this morning?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Saying these words, Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert opened without ceremony the door of a\n      room so comfortably and neatly ordered that only from internal evidence in\n      the shape of boots, uniforms, and military accoutrements did he acquire\n      the conviction that it was Lieut. Feraud&rsquo;s room. And he saw also that\n      Lieut. Feraud was not at home. The truthful maid had followed him, and\n      raised her candid eyes to his face.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; said Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert, greatly disappointed, for he had already\n      visited all the haunts where a lieutenant of hussars could be found of a\n      fine afternoon. &ldquo;So he&rsquo;s out? And do you happen to know, my dear, why he\n      went out at six this morning?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, readily. &ldquo;He came home late last night, and snored. I\n      heard him when I got up at five. Then he dressed himself in his oldest\n      uniform and went out. Service, I suppose.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Service? Not a bit of it!&rdquo; cried Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert. &ldquo;Learn, my angel, that\n      he went out thus early to fight a duel with a civilian.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      She heard this news without a quiver of her dark eyelashes. It was very\n      obvious that the actions of Lieut. Feraud were generally above criticism.\n      She only looked up for a moment in mute surprise, and Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert\n      concluded from this absence of emotion that she must have seen Lieut.\n      Feraud since the morning. He looked around the room.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he insisted, with confidential familiarity. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s perhaps\n      somewhere in the house now?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      She shook her head.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;So much the worse for him!&rdquo; continued Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert, in a tone of\n      anxious conviction. &ldquo;But he has been home this morning.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      This time the pretty maid nodded slightly.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He has!&rdquo; cried Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert. &ldquo;And went out again? What for? Couldn&rsquo;t\n      he keep quietly indoors! What a lunatic! My dear girl&mdash;&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert&rsquo;s natural kindness of disposition and strong sense of\n      comradeship helped his powers of observation. He changed his tone to a\n      most insinuating softness, and, gazing at the hussar&rsquo;s breeches hanging\n      over the arm of the girl, he appealed to the interest she took in Lieut.\n      Feraud&rsquo;s comfort and happiness. He was pressing and persuasive. He used\n      his eyes, which were kind and fine, with excellent effect. His anxiety to\n      get hold at once of Lieut. Feraud, for Lieut. Feraud&rsquo;s own good, seemed so\n      genuine that at last it overcame the girl&rsquo;s unwillingness to speak.\n      Unluckily she had not much to tell. Lieut. Feraud had returned home\n      shortly before ten, had walked straight into his room, and had thrown\n      himself on his bed to resume his slumbers. She had heard him snore rather\n      louder than before far into the afternoon. Then he got up, put on his best\n      uniform, and went out. That was all she knew.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      She raised her eyes, and Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert stared into them incredulously.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s incredible. Gone parading the town in his best uniform! My dear\n      child, don&rsquo;t you know he ran that civilian through this morning? Clean\n      through, as you spit a hare.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The pretty maid heard the gruesome intelligence without any signs of\n      distress. But she pressed her lips together thoughtfully.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t parading the town,&rdquo; she remarked in a low tone. &ldquo;Far from it.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The civilian&rsquo;s family is making an awful row,&rdquo; continued Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert,\n      pursuing his train of thought. &ldquo;And the general is very angry. It&rsquo;s one of\n      the best families in the town. Feraud ought to have kept close at least&mdash;&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;What will the general do to him?&rdquo; inquired the girl, anxiously.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t have his head cut off, to be sure,&rdquo; grumbled Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert.\n      &ldquo;His conduct is positively indecent. He&rsquo;s making no end of trouble for\n      himself by this sort of bravado.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;But he isn&rsquo;t parading the town,&rdquo; the maid insisted in a shy murmur.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Why, yes! Now I think of it, I haven&rsquo;t seen him anywhere about. What on\n      earth has he done with himself?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone to pay a call,&rdquo; suggested the maid, after a moment of silence.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert started.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;A call! Do you mean a call on a lady? The cheek of the man! And how do\n      you know this, my dear?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Without concealing her woman&rsquo;s scorn for the denseness of the masculine\n      mind, the pretty maid reminded him that Lieut. Feraud had arrayed himself\n      in his best uniform before going out. He had also put on his newest\n      dolman, she added, in a tone as if this conversation were getting on her\n      nerves, and turned away brusquely.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert, without questioning the accuracy of the deduction, did\n      not see that it advanced him much on his official quest. For his quest\n      after Lieut. Feraud had an official character. He did not know any of the\n      women this fellow, who had run a man through in the morning, was likely to\n      visit in the afternoon. The two young men knew each other but slightly. He\n      bit his gloved finger in perplexity.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Call!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Call on the devil!&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The girl, with her back to him, and folding the hussars breeches on a\n      chair, protested with a vexed little laugh:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Oh, dear, no! On Madame de Lionne.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert whistled softly. Madame de Lionne was the wife of a high\n      official who had a well-known salon and some pretensions to sensibility\n      and elegance. The husband was a civilian, and old; but the society of the\n      salon was young and military. Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert had whistled, not because\n      the idea of pursuing Lieut. Feraud into that very salon was disagreeable\n      to him, but because, having arrived in Strasbourg only lately, he had not\n      had the time as yet to get an introduction to Madame de Lionne. And what\n      was that swashbuckler Feraud doing there, he wondered. He did not seem the\n      sort of man who&mdash;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Are you certain of what you say?&rdquo; asked Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The girl was perfectly certain. Without turning round to look at him, she\n      explained that the coachman of their next door neighbours knew the\n      maitre-d&rsquo;hotel of Madame de Lionne. In this way she had her information.\n      And she was perfectly certain. In giving this assurance she sighed. Lieut.\n      Feraud called there nearly every afternoon, she added.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Ah, bah!&rdquo; exclaimed D&rsquo;Hubert, ironically. His opinion of Madame de Lionne\n      went down several degrees. Lieut. Feraud did not seem to him specially\n      worthy of attention on the part of a woman with a reputation for\n      sensibility and elegance. But there was no saying. At bottom they were all\n      alike&mdash;very practical rather than idealistic. Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert,\n      however, did not allow his mind to dwell on these considerations.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;By thunder!&rdquo; he reflected aloud. &ldquo;The general goes there sometimes. If he\n      happens to find the fellow making eyes at the lady there will be the devil\n      to pay! Our general is not a very accommodating person, I can tell you.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Go quickly, then! Don&rsquo;t stand here now I&rsquo;ve told you where he is!&rdquo; cried\n      the girl, colouring to the eyes.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Thanks, my dear! I don&rsquo;t know what I would have done without you.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      After manifesting his gratitude in an aggressive way, which at first was\n      repulsed violently, and then submitted to with a sudden and still more\n      repellent indifference, Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert took his departure.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He clanked and jingled along the streets with a martial swagger. To run a\n      comrade to earth in a drawing-room where he was not known did not trouble\n      him in the least. A uniform is a passport. His position as officier\n      d&rsquo;ordonnance of the general added to his assurance. Moreover, now that he\n      knew where to find Lieut. Feraud, he had no option. It was a service\n      matter.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Madame de Lionne&rsquo;s house had an excellent appearance. A man in livery,\n      opening the door of a large drawing-room with a waxed floor, shouted his\n      name and stood aside to let him pass. It was a reception day. The ladies\n      wore big hats surcharged with a profusion of feathers; their bodies\n      sheathed in clinging white gowns, from the armpits to the tips of the low\n      satin shoes, looked sylph-like and cool in a great display of bare necks\n      and arms. The men who talked with them, on the contrary, were arrayed\n      heavily in multi-coloured garments with collars up to their ears and thick\n      sashes round their waists. Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert made his unabashed way across\n      the room and, bowing low before a sylph-like form reclining on a couch,\n      offered his apologies for this intrusion, which nothing could excuse but\n      the extreme urgency of the service order he had to communicate to his\n      comrade Feraud. He proposed to himself to return presently in a more\n      regular manner and beg forgiveness for interrupting the interesting\n      conversation . . .\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      A bare arm was extended towards him with gracious nonchalance even before\n      he had finished speaking. He pressed the hand respectfully to his lips,\n      and made the mental remark that it was bony. Madame de Lionne was a\n      blonde, with too fine a skin and a long face.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;C&rsquo;est ca!&rdquo; she said, with an ethereal smile, disclosing a set of large\n      teeth. &ldquo;Come this evening to plead for your forgiveness.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I will not fail, madame.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Meantime, Lieut. Feraud, splendid in his new dolman and the extremely\n      polished boots of his calling, sat on a chair within a foot of the couch,\n      one hand resting on his thigh, the other twirling his moustache to a\n      point. At a significant glance from D&rsquo;Hubert he rose without alacrity, and\n      followed him into the recess of a window.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;What is it you want with me?&rdquo; he asked, with astonishing indifference.\n      Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert could not imagine that in the innocence of his heart and\n      simplicity of his conscience Lieut. Feraud took a view of his duel in\n      which neither remorse nor yet a rational apprehension of consequences had\n      any place. Though he had no clear recollection how the quarrel had\n      originated (it was begun in an establishment where beer and wine are drunk\n      late at night), he had not the slightest doubt of being himself the\n      outraged party. He had had two experienced friends for his seconds.\n      Everything had been done according to the rules governing that sort of\n      adventures. And a duel is obviously fought for the purpose of someone\n      being at least hurt, if not killed outright. The civilian got hurt. That\n      also was in order. Lieut. Feraud was perfectly tranquil; but Lieut.\n      D&rsquo;Hubert took it for affectation, and spoke with a certain vivacity.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I am directed by the general to give you the order to go at once to your\n      quarters, and remain there under close arrest.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      It was now the turn of Lieut. Feraud to be astonished. &ldquo;What the devil are\n      you telling me there?&rdquo; he murmured, faintly, and fell into such profound\n      wonder that he could only follow mechanically the motions of Lieut.\n      D&rsquo;Hubert. The two officers, one tall, with an interesting face and a\n      moustache the colour of ripe corn, the other, short and sturdy, with a\n      hooked nose and a thick crop of black curly hair, approached the mistress\n      of the house to take their leave. Madame de Lionne, a woman of eclectic\n      taste, smiled upon these armed young men with impartial sensibility and an\n      equal share of interest. Madame de Lionne took her delight in the infinite\n      variety of the human species. All the other eyes in the drawing-room\n      followed the departing officers; and when they had gone out one or two\n      men, who had already heard of the duel, imparted the information to the\n      sylph-like ladies, who received it with faint shrieks of humane concern.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Meantime, the two hussars walked side by side, Lieut. Feraud trying to\n      master the hidden reason of things which in this instance eluded the grasp\n      of his intellect, Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert feeling annoyed at the part he had to\n      play, because the general&rsquo;s instructions were that he should see\n      personally that Lieut. Feraud carried out his orders to the letter, and at\n      once.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The chief seems to know this animal,&rdquo; he thought, eyeing his companion,\n      whose round face, the round eyes, and even the twisted-up jet black little\n      moustache seemed animated by a mental exasperation against the\n      incomprehensible. And aloud he observed rather reproachfully, &ldquo;The general\n      is in a devilish fury with you!&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Lieut. Feraud stopped short on the edge of the pavement, and cried in\n      accents of unmistakable sincerity, &ldquo;What on earth for?&rdquo; The innocence of\n      the fiery Gascon soul was depicted in the manner in which he seized his\n      head in both hands as if to prevent it bursting with perplexity.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;For the duel,&rdquo; said Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert, curtly. He was annoyed greatly by\n      this sort of perverse fooling.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The duel! The . . .&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Lieut. Feraud passed from one paroxysm of astonishment into another. He\n      dropped his hands and walked on slowly, trying to reconcile this\n      information with the state of his own feelings. It was impossible. He\n      burst out indignantly, &ldquo;Was I to let that sauerkraut-eating civilian wipe\n      his boots on the uniform of the 7th Hussars?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert could not remain altogether unmoved by that simple\n      sentiment. This little fellow was a lunatic, he thought to himself, but\n      there was something in what he said.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Of course, I don&rsquo;t know how far you were justified,&rdquo; he began,\n      soothingly. &ldquo;And the general himself may not be exactly informed. Those\n      people have been deafening him with their lamentations.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Ah! the general is not exactly informed,&rdquo; mumbled Lieut. Feraud, walking\n      faster and faster as his choler at the injustice of his fate began to\n      rise. &ldquo;He is not exactly . . . And he orders me under close arrest, with\n      God knows what afterwards!&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t excite yourself like this,&rdquo; remonstrated the other. &ldquo;Your\n      adversary&rsquo;s people are very influential, you know, and it looks bad enough\n      on the face of it. The general had to take notice of their complaint at\n      once. I don&rsquo;t think he means to be over-severe with you. It&rsquo;s the best\n      thing for you to be kept out of sight for a while.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I am very much obliged to the general,&rdquo; muttered Lieut. Feraud through\n      his teeth. &ldquo;And perhaps you would say I ought to be grateful to you, too,\n      for the trouble you have taken to hunt me up in the drawing-room of a lady\n      who&mdash;&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Frankly,&rdquo; interrupted Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert, with an innocent laugh, &ldquo;I think\n      you ought to be. I had no end of trouble to find out where you were. It\n      wasn&rsquo;t exactly the place for you to disport yourself in under the\n      circumstances. If the general had caught you there making eyes at the\n      goddess of the temple . . . oh, my word! . . . He hates to be bothered\n      with complaints against his officers, you know. And it looked uncommonly\n      like sheer bravado.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The two officers had arrived now at the street door of Lieut. Feraud&rsquo;s\n      lodgings. The latter turned towards his companion. &ldquo;Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert,&rdquo; he\n      said, &ldquo;I have something to say to you, which can&rsquo;t be said very well in\n      the street. You can&rsquo;t refuse to come up.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The pretty maid had opened the door. Lieut. Feraud brushed past her\n      brusquely, and she raised her scared and questioning eyes to Lieut.\n      D&rsquo;Hubert, who could do nothing but shrug his shoulders slightly as he\n      followed with marked reluctance.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In his room Lieut. Feraud unhooked the clasp, flung his new dolman on the\n      bed, and, folding his arms across his chest, turned to the other hussar.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Do you imagine I am a man to submit tamely to injustice?&rdquo; he inquired, in\n      a boisterous voice.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Oh, do be reasonable!&rdquo; remonstrated Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I am reasonable! I am perfectly reasonable!&rdquo; retorted the other with\n      ominous restraint. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t call the general to account for his behaviour,\n      but you are going to answer me for yours.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t listen to this nonsense,&rdquo; murmured Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert, making a\n      slightly contemptuous grimace.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;You call this nonsense? It seems to me a perfectly plain statement.\n      Unless you don&rsquo;t understand French.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;What on earth do you mean?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; screamed suddenly Lieut. Feraud, &ldquo;to cut off your ears to teach\n      you to disturb me with the general&rsquo;s orders when I am talking to a lady!&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      A profound silence followed this mad declaration; and through the open\n      window Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert heard the little birds singing sanely in the\n      garden. He said, preserving his calm, &ldquo;Why! If you take that tone, of\n      course I shall hold myself at your disposition whenever you are at liberty\n      to attend to this affair; but I don&rsquo;t think you will cut my ears off.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I am going to attend to it at once,&rdquo; declared Lieut. Feraud, with extreme\n      truculence. &ldquo;If you are thinking of displaying your airs and graces\n      to-night in Madame de Lionne&rsquo;s salon you are very much mistaken.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo; said Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert, who was beginning to feel irritated, &ldquo;you\n      are an impracticable sort of fellow. The general&rsquo;s orders to me were to\n      put you under arrest, not to carve you into small pieces. Good-morning!&rdquo;\n       And turning his back on the little Gascon, who, always sober in his\n      potations, was as though born intoxicated with the sunshine of his\n      vine-ripening country, the Northman, who could drink hard on occasion, but\n      was born sober under the watery skies of Picardy, made for the door.\n      Hearing, however, the unmistakable sound behind his back of a sword drawn\n      from the scabbard, he had no option but to stop.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Devil take this mad Southerner!&rdquo; he thought, spinning round and surveying\n      with composure the warlike posture of Lieut. Feraud, with a bare sword in\n      his hand.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;At once!&mdash;at once!&rdquo; stuttered Feraud, beside himself.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;You had my answer,&rdquo; said the other, keeping his temper very well.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      At first he had been only vexed, and somewhat amused; but now his face got\n      clouded. He was asking himself seriously how he could manage to get away.\n      It was impossible to run from a man with a sword, and as to fighting him,\n      it seemed completely out of the question. He waited awhile, then said\n      exactly what was in his heart.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Drop this! I won&rsquo;t fight with you. I won&rsquo;t be made ridiculous.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Ah, you won&rsquo;t?&rdquo; hissed the Gascon. &ldquo;I suppose you prefer to be made\n      infamous. Do you hear what I say? . . . Infamous! Infamous! Infamous!&rdquo; he\n      shrieked, rising and falling on his toes and getting very red in the face.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert, on the contrary, became very pale at the sound of the\n      unsavoury word for a moment, then flushed pink to the roots of his fair\n      hair. &ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t go out to fight; you are under arrest, you lunatic!&rdquo;\n       he objected, with angry scorn.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the garden: it&rsquo;s big enough to lay out your long carcass in,&rdquo;\n       spluttered the other with such ardour that somehow the anger of the cooler\n      man subsided.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;This is perfectly absurd,&rdquo; he said, glad enough to think he had found a\n      way out of it for the moment. &ldquo;We shall never get any of our comrades to\n      serve as seconds. It&rsquo;s preposterous.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Seconds! Damn the seconds! We don&rsquo;t want any seconds. Don&rsquo;t you worry\n      about any seconds. I shall send word to your friends to come and bury you\n      when I am done. And if you want any witnesses, I&rsquo;ll send word to the old\n      girl to put her head out of a window at the back. Stay! There&rsquo;s the\n      gardener. He&rsquo;ll do. He&rsquo;s as deaf as a post, but he has two eyes in his\n      head. Come along! I will teach you, my staff officer, that the carrying\n      about of a general&rsquo;s orders is not always child&rsquo;s play.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      While thus discoursing he had unbuckled his empty scabbard. He sent it\n      flying under the bed, and, lowering the point of the sword, brushed past\n      the perplexed Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert, exclaiming, &ldquo;Follow me!&rdquo; Directly he had\n      flung open the door a faint shriek was heard and the pretty maid, who had\n      been listening at the keyhole, staggered away, putting the backs of her\n      hands over her eyes. Feraud did not seem to see her, but she ran after him\n      and seized his left arm. He shook her off, and then she rushed towards\n      Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert and clawed at the sleeve of his uniform.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Wretched man!&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;Is this what you wanted to find him for?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Let me go,&rdquo; entreated Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert, trying to disengage himself\n      gently. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like being in a madhouse,&rdquo; he protested, with exasperation.\n      &ldquo;Do let me go! I won&rsquo;t do him any harm.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      A fiendish laugh from Lieut. Feraud commented that assurance. &ldquo;Come\n      along!&rdquo; he shouted, with a stamp of his foot.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      And Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert did follow. He could do nothing else. Yet in\n      vindication of his sanity it must be recorded that as he passed through\n      the ante-room the notion of opening the street door and bolting out\n      presented itself to this brave youth, only of course to be instantly\n      dismissed, for he felt sure that the other would pursue him without shame\n      or compunction. And the prospect of an officer of hussars being chased\n      along the street by another officer of hussars with a naked sword could\n      not be for a moment entertained. Therefore he followed into the garden.\n      Behind them the girl tottered out, too. With ashy lips and wild, scared\n      eyes, she surrendered herself to a dreadful curiosity. She had also the\n      notion of rushing if need be between Lieut. Feraud and death.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The deaf gardener, utterly unconscious of approaching footsteps, went on\n      watering his flowers till Lieut. Feraud thumped him on the back. Beholding\n      suddenly an enraged man flourishing a big sabre, the old chap trembling in\n      all his limbs dropped the watering-pot. At once Lieut. Feraud kicked it\n      away with great animosity, and, seizing the gardener by the throat, backed\n      him against a tree. He held him there, shouting in his ear, &ldquo;Stay here,\n      and look on! You understand? You&rsquo;ve got to look on! Don&rsquo;t dare budge from\n      the spot!&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert came slowly down the walk, unclasping his dolman with\n      unconcealed disgust. Even then, with his hand already on the hilt of his\n      sword, he hesitated to draw till a roar, &ldquo;En garde, fichtre! What do you\n      think you came here for?&rdquo; and the rush of his adversary forced him to put\n      himself as quickly as possible in a posture of defence.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The clash of arms filled that prim garden, which hitherto had known no\n      more warlike sound than the click of clipping shears; and presently the\n      upper part of an old lady&rsquo;s body was projected out of a window upstairs.\n      She tossed her arms above her white cap, scolding in a cracked voice. The\n      gardener remained glued to the tree, his toothless mouth open in idiotic\n      astonishment, and a little farther up the path the pretty girl, as if\n      spellbound to a small grass plot, ran a few steps this way and that,\n      wringing her hands and muttering crazily. She did not rush between the\n      combatants: the onslaughts of Lieut. Feraud were so fierce that her heart\n      failed her. Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert, his faculties concentrated upon defence,\n      needed all his skill and science of the sword to stop the rushes of his\n      adversary. Twice already he had to break ground. It bothered him to feel\n      his foothold made insecure by the round, dry gravel of the path rolling\n      under the hard soles of his boots. This was most unsuitable ground, he\n      thought, keeping a watchful, narrowed gaze, shaded by long eyelashes, upon\n      the fiery stare of his thick-set adversary. This absurd affair would ruin\n      his reputation of a sensible, well-behaved, promising young officer. It\n      would damage, at any rate, his immediate prospects, and lose him the\n      good-will of his general. These worldly preoccupations were no doubt\n      misplaced in view of the solemnity of the moment. A duel, whether regarded\n      as a ceremony in the cult of honour, or even when reduced in its moral\n      essence to a form of manly sport, demands a perfect singleness of\n      intention, a homicidal austerity of mood. On the other hand, this vivid\n      concern for his future had not a bad effect inasmuch as it began to rouse\n      the anger of Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert. Some seventy seconds had elapsed since they\n      had crossed blades, and Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert had to break ground again in order\n      to avoid impaling his reckless adversary like a beetle for a cabinet of\n      specimens. The result was that misapprehending the motive, Lieut. Feraud\n      with a triumphant sort of snarl pressed his attack.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;This enraged animal will have me against the wall directly,&rdquo; thought\n      Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert. He imagined himself much closer to the house than he was,\n      and he dared not turn his head; it seemed to him that he was keeping his\n      adversary off with his eyes rather more than with his point. Lieut. Feraud\n      crouched and bounded with a fierce tigerish agility fit to trouble the\n      stoutest heart. But what was more appalling than the fury of a wild beast,\n      accomplishing in all innocence of heart a natural function, was the fixity\n      of savage purpose man alone is capable of displaying. Lieut. D &lsquo;Hubert in\n      the midst of his worldly preoccupations perceived it at last. It was an\n      absurd and damaging affair to be drawn into, but whatever silly intention\n      the fellow had started with, it was clear enough that by this time he\n      meant to kill&mdash;nothing less. He meant it with an intensity of will\n      utterly beyond the inferior faculties of a tiger.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      As is the case with constitutionally brave men, the full view of the\n      danger interested Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert. And directly he got properly\n      interested, the length of his arm and the coolness of his head told in his\n      favour. It was the turn of Lieut. Feraud to recoil, with a bloodcurdling\n      grunt of baffled rage. He made a swift feint, and then rushed straight\n      forward.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Ah! you would, would you?&rdquo; Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert exclaimed, mentally. The\n      combat had lasted nearly two minutes, time enough for any man to get\n      embittered, apart from the merits of the quarrel. And all at once it was\n      over. Trying to close breast to breast under his adversary&rsquo;s guard Lieut.\n      Feraud received a slash on his shortened arm. He did not feel it in the\n      least, but it checked his rush, and his feet slipping on the gravel he\n      fell backwards with great violence. The shock jarred his boiling brain\n      into the perfect quietude of insensibility. Simultaneously with his fall\n      the pretty servant-girl shrieked; but the old maiden lady at the window\n      ceased her scolding, and began to cross herself piously.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Beholding his adversary stretched out perfectly still, his face to the\n      sky, Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert thought he had killed him outright. The impression of\n      having slashed hard enough to cut his man clean in two abode with him for\n      a while in an exaggerated memory of the right good-will he had put into\n      the blow. He dropped on his knees hastily by the side of the prostrate\n      body. Discovering that not even the arm was severed, a slight sense of\n      disappointment mingled with the feeling of relief. The fellow deserved the\n      worst. But truly he did not want the death of that sinner. The affair was\n      ugly enough as it stood, and Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert addressed himself at once to\n      the task of stopping the bleeding. In this task it was his fate to be\n      ridiculously impeded by the pretty maid. Rending the air with screams of\n      horror, she attacked him from behind and, twining her fingers in his hair,\n      tugged back at his head. Why she should choose to hinder him at this\n      precise moment he could not in the least understand. He did not try. It\n      was all like a very wicked and harassing dream. Twice to save himself from\n      being pulled over he had to rise and fling her off. He did this stoically,\n      without a word, kneeling down again at once to go on with his work. But\n      the third time, his work being done, he seized her and held her arms\n      pinned to her body. Her cap was half off, her face was red, her eyes\n      blazed with crazy boldness. He looked mildly into them while she called\n      him a wretch, a traitor, and a murderer many times in succession. This did\n      not annoy him so much as the conviction that she had managed to scratch\n      his face abundantly. Ridicule would be added to the scandal of the story.\n      He imagined the adorned tale making its way through the garrison of the\n      town, through the whole army on the frontier, with every possible\n      distortion of motive and sentiment and circumstance, spreading a doubt\n      upon the sanity of his conduct and the distinction of his taste even to\n      the very ears of his honourable family. It was all very well for that\n      fellow Feraud, who had no connections, no family to speak of, and no\n      quality but courage, which, anyhow, was a matter of course, and possessed\n      by every single trooper in the whole mass of French cavalry. Still holding\n      down the arms of the girl in a strong grip, Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert glanced over\n      his shoulder. Lieut. Feraud had opened his eyes. He did not move. Like a\n      man just waking from a deep sleep he stared without any expression at the\n      evening sky.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert&rsquo;s urgent shouts to the old gardener produced no effect&mdash;not\n      so much as to make him shut his toothless mouth. Then he remembered that\n      the man was stone deaf. All that time the girl struggled, not with\n      maidenly coyness, but like a pretty, dumb fury, kicking his shins now and\n      then. He continued to hold her as if in a vice, his instinct telling him\n      that were he to let her go she would fly at his eyes. But he was greatly\n      humiliated by his position. At last she gave up. She was more exhausted\n      than appeased, he feared. Nevertheless, he attempted to get out of this\n      wicked dream by way of negotiation.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; he said, as calmly as he could. &ldquo;Will you promise to run\n      for a surgeon if I let you go?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      With real affliction he heard her declare that she would do nothing of the\n      kind. On the contrary, her sobbed out intention was to remain in the\n      garden, and fight tooth and nail for the protection of the vanquished man.\n      This was shocking.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;My dear child!&rdquo; he cried in despair, &ldquo;is it possible that you think me\n      capable of murdering a wounded adversary? Is it. . . . Be quiet, you\n      little wild cat, you!&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      They struggled. A thick, drowsy voice said behind him, &ldquo;What are you after\n      with that girl?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Lieut. Feraud had raised himself on his good arm. He was looking sleepily\n      at his other arm, at the mess of blood on his uniform, at a small red pool\n      on the ground, at his sabre lying a foot away on the path. Then he laid\n      himself down gently again to think it all out, as far as a thundering\n      headache would permit of mental operations.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert released the girl who crouched at once by the side of the\n      other lieutenant. The shades of night were falling on the little trim\n      garden with this touching group, whence proceeded low murmurs of sorrow\n      and compassion, with other feeble sounds of a different character, as if\n      an imperfectly awake invalid were trying to swear. Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert went\n      away.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He passed through the silent house, and congratulated himself upon the\n      dusk concealing his gory hands and scratched face from the passers-by. But\n      this story could by no means be concealed. He dreaded the discredit and\n      ridicule above everything, and was painfully aware of sneaking through the\n      back streets in the manner of a murderer. Presently the sounds of a flute\n      coming out of the open window of a lighted upstairs room in a modest house\n      interrupted his dismal reflections. It was being played with a persevering\n      virtuosity, and through the fioritures of the tune one could hear the\n      regular thumping of the foot beating time on the floor.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert shouted a name, which was that of an army surgeon whom he\n      knew fairly well. The sounds of the flute ceased, and the musician\n      appeared at the window, his instrument still in his hand, peering into the\n      street.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Who calls? You, D&rsquo;Hubert? What brings you this way?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      He did not like to be disturbed at the hour when he was playing the flute.\n      He was a man whose hair had turned grey already in the thankless task of\n      tying up wounds on battlefields where others reaped advancement and glory.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I want you to go at once and see Feraud. You know Lieut. Feraud? He lives\n      down the second street. It&rsquo;s but a step from here.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with him?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Wounded.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; cried D&rsquo;Hubert. &ldquo;I come from there.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s amusing,&rdquo; said the elderly surgeon. Amusing was his favourite\n      word; but the expression of his face when he pronounced it never\n      corresponded. He was a stolid man. &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get ready in\n      a moment.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Thanks! I will. I want to wash my hands in your room.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert found the surgeon occupied in unscrewing his flute, and\n      packing the pieces methodically in a case. He turned his head.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Water there&mdash;in the corner. Your hands do want washing.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve stopped the bleeding,&rdquo; said Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert. &ldquo;But you had better\n      make haste. It&rsquo;s rather more than ten minutes ago, you know.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The surgeon did not hurry his movements.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Dressing came off? That&rsquo;s amusing. I&rsquo;ve been at work\n      in the hospital all day but I&rsquo;ve been told this morning by somebody that\n      he had come off without a scratch.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Not the same duel probably,&rdquo; growled moodily Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert, wiping his\n      hands on a coarse towel.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Not the same. . . . What? Another. It would take the very devil to make\n      me go out twice in one day.&rdquo; The surgeon looked narrowly at Lieut.\n      D&rsquo;Hubert. &ldquo;How did you come by that scratched face? Both sides, too&mdash;and\n      symmetrical. It&rsquo;s amusing.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Very!&rdquo; snarled Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert. &ldquo;And you will find his slashed arm\n      amusing, too. It will keep both of you amused for quite a long time.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The doctor was mystified and impressed by the brusque bitterness of Lieut.\n      D&rsquo;Hubert&rsquo;s tone. They left the house together, and in the street he was\n      still more mystified by his conduct.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you coming with me?&rdquo; he asked.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert. &ldquo;You can find the house by yourself. The front\n      door will be standing open very likely.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;All right. Where&rsquo;s his room?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Ground floor. But you had better go right through and look in the garden\n      first.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      This astonishing piece of information made the surgeon go off without\n      further parley. Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert regained his quarters nursing a hot and\n      uneasy indignation. He dreaded the chaff of his comrades almost as much as\n      the anger of his superiors. The truth was confoundedly grotesque and\n      embarrassing, even putting aside the irregularity of the combat itself,\n      which made it come abominably near a criminal offence. Like all men\n      without much imagination, a faculty which helps the process of reflective\n      thought, Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert became frightfully harassed by the obvious\n      aspects of his predicament. He was certainly glad that he had not killed\n      Lieut. Feraud outside all rules, and without the regular witnesses proper\n      to such a transaction. Uncommonly glad. At the same time he felt as though\n      he would have liked to wring his neck for him without ceremony.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He was still under the sway of these contradictory sentiments when the\n      surgeon amateur of the flute came to see him. More than three days had\n      elapsed. Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert was no longer officier d&rsquo;ordonnance to the\n      general commanding the division. He had been sent back to his regiment.\n      And he was resuming his connection with the soldiers&rsquo; military family by\n      being shut up in close confinement, not at his own quarters in town, but\n      in a room in the barracks. Owing to the gravity of the incident, he was\n      forbidden to see any one. He did not know what had happened, what was\n      being said, or what was being thought. The arrival of the surgeon was a\n      most unexpected thing to the worried captive. The amateur of the flute\n      began by explaining that he was there only by a special favour of the\n      colonel.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I represented to him that it would be only fair to let you have some\n      authentic news of your adversary,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be glad to hear\n      he&rsquo;s getting better fast.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert&rsquo;s face exhibited no conventional signs of gladness. He\n      continued to walk the floor of the dusty bare room.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Take this chair, doctor,&rdquo; he mumbled.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The doctor sat down.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;This affair is variously appreciated&mdash;in town and in the army. In\n      fact, the diversity of opinions is amusing.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Is it!&rdquo; mumbled Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert, tramping steadily from wall to wall. But\n      within himself he marvelled that there could be two opinions on the\n      matter. The surgeon continued.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Of course, as the real facts are not known&mdash;&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I should have thought,&rdquo; interrupted D&rsquo;Hubert, &ldquo;that the fellow would have\n      put you in possession of facts.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He said something,&rdquo; admitted the other, &ldquo;the first time I saw him. And,\n      by the by, I did find him in the garden. The thump on the back of his head\n      had made him a little incoherent then. Afterwards he was rather reticent\n      than otherwise.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t think he would have the grace to be ashamed!&rdquo; mumbled D&rsquo;Hubert,\n      resuming his pacing while the doctor murmured, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very amusing.\n      Ashamed! Shame was not exactly his frame of mind. However, you may look at\n      the matter otherwise.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;What are you talking about? What matter?&rdquo; asked D&rsquo;Hubert, with a sidelong\n      look at the heavy-faced, grey-haired figure seated on a wooden chair.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Whatever it is,&rdquo; said the surgeon a little impatiently, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to\n      pronounce any opinion on your conduct&mdash;&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;By heavens, you had better not!&rdquo; burst out D&rsquo;Hubert.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;There!&mdash;there! Don&rsquo;t be so quick in flourishing the sword. It\n      doesn&rsquo;t pay in the long run. Understand once for all that I would not\n      carve any of you youngsters except with the tools of my trade. But my\n      advice is good. If you go on like this you will make for yourself an ugly\n      reputation.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Go on like what?&rdquo; demanded Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert, stopping short, quite\n      startled. &ldquo;I!&mdash;I!&mdash;make for myself a reputation. . . . What do\n      you imagine?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I told you I don&rsquo;t wish to judge of the rights and wrongs of this\n      incident. It&rsquo;s not my business. Nevertheless&mdash;&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;What on earth has he been telling you?&rdquo; interrupted Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert, in a\n      sort of awed scare.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I told you already, that at first, when I picked him up in the garden, he\n      was incoherent. Afterwards he was naturally reticent. But I gather at\n      least that he could not help himself.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo; shouted Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert in a great voice. Then, lowering\n      his tone impressively, &ldquo;And what about me? Could I help myself?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The surgeon stood up. His thoughts were running upon the flute, his\n      constant companion with a consoling voice. In the vicinity of field\n      ambulances, after twenty-four hours&rsquo; hard work, he had been known to\n      trouble with its sweet sounds the horrible stillness of battlefields,\n      given over to silence and the dead. The solacing hour of his daily life\n      was approaching, and in peace time he held on to the minutes as a miser to\n      his hoard.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Of course!&mdash;of course!&rdquo; he said, perfunctorily. &ldquo;You would think so.\n      It&rsquo;s amusing. However, being perfectly neutral and friendly to you both, I\n      have consented to deliver his message to you. Say that I am humouring an\n      invalid if you like. He wants you to know that this affair is by no means\n      at an end. He intends to send you his seconds directly he has regained his\n      strength&mdash;providing, of course, the army is not in the field at that\n      time.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He intends, does he? Why, certainly,&rdquo; spluttered Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert in a\n      passion.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The secret of his exasperation was not apparent to the visitor; but this\n      passion confirmed the surgeon in the belief which was gaining ground\n      outside that some very serious difference had arisen between these two\n      young men, something serious enough to wear an air of mystery, some fact\n      of the utmost gravity. To settle their urgent difference about that fact,\n      those two young men had risked being broken and disgraced at the outset\n      almost of their career. The surgeon feared that the forthcoming inquiry\n      would fail to satisfy the public curiosity. They would not take the public\n      into their confidence as to that something which had passed between them\n      of a nature so outrageous as to make them face a charge of murder&mdash;neither\n      more nor less. But what could it be?\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The surgeon was not very curious by temperament; but that question\n      haunting his mind caused him twice that evening to hold the instrument off\n      his lips and sit silent for a whole minute&mdash;right in the middle of a\n      tune&mdash;trying to form a plausible conjecture.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      II\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He succeeded in this object no better than the rest of the garrison and\n      the whole of society. The two young officers, of no especial consequence\n      till then, became distinguished by the universal curiosity as to the\n      origin of their quarrel. Madame de Lionne&rsquo;s salon was the centre of\n      ingenious surmises; that lady herself was for a time assailed by inquiries\n      as being the last person known to have spoken to these unhappy and\n      reckless young men before they went out together from her house to a\n      savage encounter with swords, at dusk, in a private garden. She protested\n      she had not observed anything unusual in their demeanour. Lieut. Feraud\n      had been visibly annoyed at being called away. That was natural enough; no\n      man likes to be disturbed in a conversation with a lady famed for her\n      elegance and sensibility. But in truth the subject bored Madame de Lionne,\n      since her personality could by no stretch of reckless gossip be connected\n      with this affair. And it irritated her to hear it advanced that there\n      might have been some woman in the case. This irritation arose, not from\n      her elegance or sensibility, but from a more instinctive side of her\n      nature. It became so great at last that she peremptorily forbade the\n      subject to be mentioned under her roof. Near her couch the prohibition was\n      obeyed, but farther off in the salon the pall of the imposed silence\n      continued to be lifted more or less. A personage with a long, pale face,\n      resembling the countenance of a sheep, opined, shaking his head, that it\n      was a quarrel of long standing envenomed by time. It was objected to him\n      that the men themselves were too young for such a theory. They belonged\n      also to different and distant parts of France. There were other physical\n      impossibilities, too. A sub-commissary of the Intendence, an agreeable and\n      cultivated bachelor in kerseymere breeches, Hessian boots, and a blue coat\n      embroidered with silver lace, who affected to believe in the\n      transmigration of souls, suggested that the two had met perhaps in some\n      previous existence. The feud was in the forgotten past. It might have been\n      something quite inconceivable in the present state of their being; but\n      their souls remembered the animosity, and manifested an instinctive\n      antagonism. He developed this theme jocularly. Yet the affair was so\n      absurd from the worldly, the military, the honourable, or the prudential\n      point of view, that this weird explanation seemed rather more reasonable\n      than any other.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The two officers had confided nothing definite to any one. Humiliation at\n      having been worsted arms in hand, and an uneasy feeling of having been\n      involved in a scrape by the injustice of fate, kept Lieut. Feraud savagely\n      dumb. He mistrusted the sympathy of mankind. That would, of course, go to\n      that dandified staff officer. Lying in bed, he raved aloud to the pretty\n      maid who administered to his needs with devotion, and listened to his\n      horrible imprecations with alarm. That Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert should be made to\n      &ldquo;pay for it,&rdquo; seemed to her just and natural. Her principal care was that\n      Lieut. Feraud should not excite himself. He appeared so wholly admirable\n      and fascinating to the humility of her heart that her only concern was to\n      see him get well quickly, even if it were only to resume his visits to\n      Madame de Lionne&rsquo;s salon.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert kept silent for the immediate reason that there was no\n      one, except a stupid young soldier servant, to speak to. Further, he was\n      aware that the episode, so grave professionally, had its comic side. When\n      reflecting upon it, he still felt that he would like to wring Lieut.\n      Feraud&rsquo;s neck for him. But this formula was figurative rather than\n      precise, and expressed more a state of mind than an actual physical\n      impulse. At the same time, there was in that young man a feeling of\n      comradeship and kindness which made him unwilling to make the position of\n      Lieut. Feraud worse than it was. He did not want to talk at large about\n      this wretched affair. At the inquiry he would have, of course, to speak\n      the truth in self-defence. This prospect vexed him.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      But no inquiry took place. The army took the field instead. Lieut.\n      D&rsquo;Hubert, liberated without remark, took up his regimental duties; and\n      Lieut. Feraud, his arm just out of the sling, rode unquestioned with his\n      squadron to complete his convalescence in the smoke of battlefields and\n      the fresh air of night bivouacs. This bracing treatment suited him so\n      well, that at the first rumour of an armistice being signed he could turn\n      without misgivings to the thoughts of his private warfare.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      This time it was to be regular warfare. He sent two friends to Lieut.\n      D&rsquo;Hubert, whose regiment was stationed only a few miles away. Those\n      friends had asked no questions of their principal. &ldquo;I owe him one, that\n      pretty staff officer,&rdquo; he had said, grimly, and they went away quite\n      contentedly on their mission. Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert had no difficulty in finding\n      two friends equally discreet and devoted to their principal. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a\n      crazy fellow to whom I must give a lesson,&rdquo; he had declared curtly; and\n      they asked for no better reasons.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      On these grounds an encounter with duelling-swords was arranged one early\n      morning in a convenient field. At the third set-to Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert found\n      himself lying on his back on the dewy grass with a hole in his side. A\n      serene sun rising over a landscape of meadows and woods hung on his left.\n      A surgeon&mdash;not the flute player, but another&mdash;was bending over\n      him, feeling around the wound.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Narrow squeak. But it will be nothing,&rdquo; he pronounced.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert heard these words with pleasure. One of his seconds,\n      sitting on the wet grass, and sustaining his head on his lap, said, &ldquo;The\n      fortune of war, mon pauvre vieux. What will you have? You had better make\n      it up like two good fellows. Do!&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you ask,&rdquo; murmured Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert, in a feeble\n      voice. &ldquo;However, if he . . .&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      In another part of the meadow the seconds of Lieut. Feraud were urging him\n      to go over and shake hands with his adversary.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;You have paid him off now&mdash;que diable. It&rsquo;s the proper thing to do.\n      This D&rsquo;Hubert is a decent fellow.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I know the decency of these generals&rsquo; pets,&rdquo; muttered Lieut. Feraud\n      through his teeth, and the sombre expression of his face discouraged\n      further efforts at reconciliation. The seconds, bowing from a distance,\n      took their men off the field. In the afternoon Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert, very\n      popular as a good comrade uniting great bravery with a frank and equable\n      temper, had many visitors. It was remarked that Lieut. Feraud did not, as\n      is customary, show himself much abroad to receive the felicitations of his\n      friends. They would not have failed him, because he, too, was liked for\n      the exuberance of his southern nature and the simplicity of his character.\n      In all the places where officers were in the habit of assembling at the\n      end of the day the duel of the morning was talked over from every point of\n      view. Though Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert had got worsted this time, his sword play was\n      commended. No one could deny that it was very close, very scientific. It\n      was even whispered that if he got touched it was because he wished to\n      spare his adversary. But by many the vigour and dash of Lieut. Feraud&rsquo;s\n      attack were pronounced irresistible.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The merits of the two officers as combatants were frankly discussed; but\n      their attitude to each other after the duel was criticised lightly and\n      with caution. It was irreconcilable, and that was to be regretted. But\n      after all they knew best what the care of their honour dictated. It was\n      not a matter for their comrades to pry into over-much. As to the origin of\n      the quarrel, the general impression was that it dated from the time they\n      were holding garrison in Strasbourg. The musical surgeon shook his head at\n      that. It went much farther back, he thought.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Why, of course! You must know the whole story,&rdquo; cried several voices,\n      eager with curiosity. &ldquo;What was it?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      He raised his eyes from his glass deliberately. &ldquo;Even if I knew ever so\n      well, you can&rsquo;t expect me to tell you, since both the principals choose to\n      say nothing.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      He got up and went out, leaving the sense of mystery behind him. He could\n      not stay any longer, because the witching hour of flute-playing was\n      drawing near.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      After he had gone a very young officer observed solemnly, &ldquo;Obviously, his\n      lips are sealed!&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Nobody questioned the high correctness of that remark. Somehow it added to\n      the impressiveness of the affair. Several older officers of both\n      regiments, prompted by nothing but sheer kindness and love of harmony,\n      proposed to form a Court of Honour, to which the two young men would leave\n      the task of their reconciliation. Unfortunately they began by approaching\n      Lieut. Feraud, on the assumption that, having just scored heavily, he\n      would be found placable and disposed to moderation.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The reasoning was sound enough. Nevertheless, the move turned out\n      unfortunate. In that relaxation of moral fibre, which is brought about by\n      the ease of soothed vanity, Lieut. Feraud had condescended in the secret\n      of his heart to review the case, and even had come to doubt not the\n      justice of his cause, but the absolute sagacity of his conduct. This being\n      so, he was disinclined to talk about it. The suggestion of the regimental\n      wise men put him in a difficult position. He was disgusted at it, and this\n      disgust, by a paradoxical logic, reawakened his animosity against Lieut.\n      D&rsquo;Hubert. Was he to be pestered with this fellow for ever&mdash;the fellow\n      who had an infernal knack of getting round people somehow? And yet it was\n      difficult to refuse point blank that mediation sanctioned by the code of\n      honour.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He met the difficulty by an attitude of grim reserve. He twisted his\n      moustache and used vague words. His case was perfectly clear. He was not\n      ashamed to state it before a proper Court of Honour, neither was he afraid\n      to defend it on the ground. He did not see any reason to jump at the\n      suggestion before ascertaining how his adversary was likely to take it.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Later in the day, his exasperation growing upon him, he was heard in a\n      public place saying sardonically, &ldquo;that it would be the very luckiest\n      thing for Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert, because the next time of meeting he need not\n      hope to get off with the mere trifle of three weeks in bed.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      This boastful phrase might have been prompted by the most profound\n      Machiavellism. Southern natures often hide, under the outward\n      impulsiveness of action and speech, a certain amount of astuteness.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Lieut. Feraud, mistrusting the justice of men, by no means desired a Court\n      of Honour; and the above words, according so well with his temperament,\n      had also the merit of serving his turn. Whether meant so or not, they\n      found their way in less than four-and-twenty hours into Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert&rsquo;s\n      bedroom. In consequence Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert, sitting propped up with pillows,\n      received the overtures made to him next day by the statement that the\n      affair was of a nature which could not bear discussion.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The pale face of the wounded officer, his weak voice which he had yet to\n      use cautiously, and the courteous dignity of his tone had a great effect\n      on his hearers. Reported outside all this did more for deepening the\n      mystery than the vapourings of Lieut. Feraud. This last was greatly\n      relieved at the issue. He began to enjoy the state of general wonder, and\n      was pleased to add to it by assuming an attitude of fierce discretion.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The colonel of Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert&rsquo;s regiment was a grey-haired,\n      weather-beaten warrior, who took a simple view of his responsibilities. &ldquo;I\n      can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;let the best of my subalterns get damaged\n      like this for nothing. I must get to the bottom of this affair privately.\n      He must speak out if the devil were in it. The colonel should be more than\n      a father to these youngsters.&rdquo; And indeed he loved all his men with as\n      much affection as a father of a large family can feel for every individual\n      member of it. If human beings by an oversight of Providence came into the\n      world as mere civilians, they were born again into a regiment as infants\n      are born into a family, and it was that military birth alone which\n      counted.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      At the sight of Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert standing before him very bleached and\n      hollow-eyed the heart of the old warrior felt a pang of genuine\n      compassion. All his affection for the regiment&mdash;that body of men\n      which he held in his hand to launch forward and draw back, who ministered\n      to his pride and commanded all his thoughts&mdash;seemed centred for a\n      moment on the person of the most promising subaltern. He cleared his\n      throat in a threatening manner, and frowned terribly. &ldquo;You must\n      understand,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;that I don&rsquo;t care a rap for the life of a single\n      man in the regiment. I would send the eight hundred and forty-three of you\n      men and horses galloping into the pit of perdition with no more\n      compunction than I would kill a fly!&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Yes, Colonel. You would be riding at our head,&rdquo; said Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert with\n      a wan smile.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The colonel, who felt the need of being very diplomatic, fairly roared at\n      this. &ldquo;I want you to know, Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert, that I could stand aside and\n      see you all riding to Hades if need be. I am a man to do even that if the\n      good of the service and my duty to my country required it from me. But\n      that&rsquo;s unthinkable, so don&rsquo;t you even hint at such a thing.&rdquo; He glared\n      awfully, but his tone softened. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some milk yet about that\n      moustache of yours, my boy. You don&rsquo;t know what a man like me is capable\n      of. I would hide behind a haystack if . . . Don&rsquo;t grin at me, sir! How\n      dare you? If this were not a private conversation I would . . . Look here!\n      I am responsible for the proper expenditure of lives under my command for\n      the glory of our country and the honour of the regiment. Do you understand\n      that? Well, then, what the devil do you mean by letting yourself be\n      spitted like this by that fellow of the 7th Hussars? It&rsquo;s simply\n      disgraceful!&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert felt vexed beyond measure. His shoulders moved slightly.\n      He made no other answer. He could not ignore his responsibility.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The colonel veiled his glance and lowered his voice still more. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s\n      deplorable!&rdquo; he murmured. And again he changed his tone. &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he went\n      on, persuasively, but with that note of authority which dwells in the\n      throat of a good leader of men, &ldquo;this affair must be settled. I desire to\n      be told plainly what it is all about. I demand, as your best friend, to\n      know.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The compelling power of authority, the persuasive influence of kindness,\n      affected powerfully a man just risen from a bed of sickness. Lieut.\n      D&rsquo;Hubert&rsquo;s hand, which grasped the knob of a stick, trembled slightly. But\n      his northern temperament, sentimental yet cautious and clear-sighted, too,\n      in its idealistic way, checked his impulse to make a clean breast of the\n      whole deadly absurdity. According to the precept of transcendental wisdom,\n      he turned his tongue seven times in his mouth before he spoke. He made\n      then only a speech of thanks.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The colonel listened, interested at first, then looked mystified. At last\n      he frowned. &ldquo;You hesitate?&mdash;mille tonnerres! Haven&rsquo;t I told you that\n      I will condescend to argue with you&mdash;as a friend?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Yes, Colonel!&rdquo; answered Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert, gently. &ldquo;But I am afraid that\n      after you have heard me out as a friend you will take action as my\n      superior officer.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The attentive colonel snapped his jaws. &ldquo;Well, what of that?&rdquo; he said,\n      frankly. &ldquo;Is it so damnably disgraceful?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It is not,&rdquo; negatived Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert, in a faint but firm voice.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Of course, I shall act for the good of the service. Nothing can prevent\n      me doing that. What do you think I want to be told for?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I know it is not from idle curiosity,&rdquo; protested Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert. &ldquo;I know\n      you will act wisely. But what about the good fame of the regiment?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It cannot be affected by any youthful folly of a lieutenant,&rdquo; said the\n      colonel, severely.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;No. It cannot be. But it can be by evil tongues. It will be said that a\n      lieutenant of the 4th Hussars, afraid of meeting his adversary, is hiding\n      behind his colonel. And that would be worse than hiding behind a haystack&mdash;for\n      the good of the service. I cannot afford to do that, Colonel.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Nobody would dare to say anything of the kind,&rdquo; began the colonel very\n      fiercely, but ended the phrase on an uncertain note. The bravery of Lieut.\n      D&rsquo;Hubert was well known. But the colonel was well aware that the duelling\n      courage, the single combat courage, is rightly or wrongly supposed to be\n      courage of a special sort. And it was eminently necessary that an officer\n      of his regiment should possess every kind of courage&mdash;and prove it,\n      too. The colonel stuck out his lower lip, and looked far away with a\n      peculiar glazed stare. This was the expression of his perplexity&mdash;an\n      expression practically unknown to his regiment; for perplexity is a\n      sentiment which is incompatible with the rank of colonel of cavalry. The\n      colonel himself was overcome by the unpleasant novelty of the sensation.\n      As he was not accustomed to think except on professional matters connected\n      with the welfare of men and horses, and the proper use thereof on the\n      field of glory, his intellectual efforts degenerated into mere mental\n      repetitions of profane language. &ldquo;Mille tonnerres! . . . Sacre nom de nom\n      . . .&rdquo; he thought.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert coughed painfully, and added in a weary voice: &ldquo;There will\n      be plenty of evil tongues to say that I&rsquo;ve been cowed. And I am sure you\n      will not expect me to pass that over. I may find myself suddenly with a\n      dozen duels on my hands instead of this one affair.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The direct simplicity of this argument came home to the colonel&rsquo;s\n      understanding. He looked at his subordinate fixedly. &ldquo;Sit down,\n      Lieutenant!&rdquo; he said, gruffly. &ldquo;This is the very devil of a . . . Sit\n      down!&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Mon Colonel,&rdquo; D&rsquo;Hubert began again, &ldquo;I am not afraid of evil tongues.\n      There&rsquo;s a way of silencing them. But there&rsquo;s my peace of mind, too. I\n      wouldn&rsquo;t be able to shake off the notion that I&rsquo;ve ruined a brother\n      officer. Whatever action you take, it is bound to go farther. The inquiry\n      has been dropped&mdash;let it rest now. It would have been absolutely\n      fatal to Feraud.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Hey! What! Did he behave so badly?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Yes. It was pretty bad,&rdquo; muttered Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert. Being still very weak,\n      he felt a disposition to cry.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      As the other man did not belong to his own regiment the colonel had no\n      difficulty in believing this. He began to pace up and down the room. He\n      was a good chief, a man capable of discreet sympathy. But he was human in\n      other ways, too, and this became apparent because he was not capable of\n      artifice.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The very devil, Lieutenant,&rdquo; he blurted out, in the innocence of his\n      heart, &ldquo;is that I have declared my intention to get to the bottom of this\n      affair. And when a colonel says something . . . you see . . .&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert broke in earnestly: &ldquo;Let me entreat you, Colonel, to be\n      satisfied with taking my word of honour that I was put into a damnable\n      position where I had no option; I had no choice whatever, consistent with\n      my dignity as a man and an officer. . . . After all, Colonel, this fact is\n      the very bottom of this affair. Here you&rsquo;ve got it. The rest is mere\n      detail. . . .&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The colonel stopped short. The reputation of Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert for good\n      sense and good temper weighed in the balance. A cool head, a warm heart,\n      open as the day. Always correct in his behaviour. One had to trust him.\n      The colonel repressed manfully an immense curiosity. &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! You affirm that\n      as a man and an officer. . . . No option? Eh?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;As an officer&mdash;an officer of the 4th Hussars, too,&rdquo; insisted Lieut.\n      D&rsquo;Hubert, &ldquo;I had not. And that is the bottom of the affair, Colonel.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Yes. But still I don&rsquo;t see why, to one&rsquo;s colonel. . . . A colonel is a\n      father&mdash;que diable!&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert ought not to have been allowed out as yet. He was becoming\n      aware of his physical insufficiency with humiliation and despair. But the\n      morbid obstinacy of an invalid possessed him, and at the same time he felt\n      with dismay his eyes filling with water. This trouble seemed too big to\n      handle. A tear fell down the thin, pale cheek of Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The colonel turned his back on him hastily. You could have heard a pin\n      drop. &ldquo;This is some silly woman story&mdash;is it not?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Saying these words the chief spun round to seize the truth, which is not a\n      beautiful shape living in a well, but a shy bird best caught by stratagem.\n      This was the last move of the colonel&rsquo;s diplomacy. He saw the truth\n      shining unmistakably in the gesture of Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert raising his weak\n      arms and his eyes to heaven in supreme protest.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Not a woman affair&mdash;eh?&rdquo; growled the colonel, staring hard. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t\n      ask you who or where. All I want to know is whether there is a woman in\n      it?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert&rsquo;s arms dropped, and his weak voice was pathetically\n      broken.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Nothing of the kind, mon Colonel.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;On your honour?&rdquo; insisted the old warrior.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;On my honour.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the colonel, thoughtfully, and bit his lip. The\n      arguments of Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert, helped by his liking for the man, had\n      convinced him. On the other hand, it was highly improper that his\n      intervention, of which he had made no secret, should produce no visible\n      effect. He kept Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert a few minutes longer, and dismissed him\n      kindly.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Take a few days more in bed. Lieutenant. What the devil does the surgeon\n      mean by reporting you fit for duty?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      On coming out of the colonel&rsquo;s quarters, Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert said nothing to\n      the friend who was waiting outside to take him home. He said nothing to\n      anybody. Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert made no confidences. But on the evening of that\n      day the colonel, strolling under the elms growing near his quarters, in\n      the company of his second in command, opened his lips.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to the bottom of this affair,&rdquo; he remarked. The lieut.-colonel,\n      a dry, brown chip of a man with short side-whiskers, pricked up his ears\n      at that without letting a sign of curiosity escape him.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no trifle,&rdquo; added the colonel, oracularly. The other waited for a\n      long while before he murmured:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Indeed, sir!&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;No trifle,&rdquo; repeated the colonel, looking straight before him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve,\n      however, forbidden D&rsquo;Hubert either to send to or receive a challenge from\n      Feraud for the next twelve months.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      He had imagined this prohibition to save the prestige a colonel should\n      have. The result of it was to give an official seal to the mystery\n      surrounding this deadly quarrel. Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert repelled by an impassive\n      silence all attempts to worm the truth out of him. Lieut. Feraud, secretly\n      uneasy at first, regained his assurance as time went on. He disguised his\n      ignorance of the meaning of the imposed truce by slight sardonic laughs,\n      as though he were amused by what he intended to keep to himself. &ldquo;But what\n      will you do?&rdquo; his chums used to ask him. He contented himself by replying\n      &ldquo;Qui vivra verra&rdquo; with a little truculent air. And everybody admired his\n      discretion.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Before the end of the truce Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert got his troop. The promotion\n      was well earned, but somehow no one seemed to expect the event. When\n      Lieut. Feraud heard of it at a gathering of officers, he muttered through\n      his teeth, &ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; At once he unhooked his sabre from a peg near the\n      door, buckled it on carefully, and left the company without another word.\n      He walked home with measured steps, struck a light with his flint and\n      steel, and lit his tallow candle. Then snatching an unlucky glass tumbler\n      off the mantelpiece he dashed it violently on the floor.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Now that D&rsquo;Hubert was an officer of superior rank there could be no\n      question of a duel. Neither of them could send or receive a challenge\n      without rendering himself amenable to a court-martial. It was not to be\n      thought of. Lieut. Feraud, who for many days now had experienced no real\n      desire to meet Lieut. D&rsquo;Hubert arms in hand, chafed again at the\n      systematic injustice of fate. &ldquo;Does he think he will escape me in that\n      way?&rdquo; he thought, indignantly. He saw in this promotion an intrigue, a\n      conspiracy, a cowardly manoeuvre. That colonel knew what he was doing. He\n      had hastened to recommend his favourite for a step. It was outrageous that\n      a man should be able to avoid the consequences of his acts in such a dark\n      and tortuous manner.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Of a happy-go-lucky disposition, of a temperament more pugnacious than\n      military, Lieut. Feraud had been content to give and receive blows for\n      sheer love of armed strife, and without much thought of advancement; but\n      now an urgent desire to get on sprang up in his breast. This fighter by\n      vocation resolved in his mind to seize showy occasions and to court the\n      favourable opinion of his chiefs like a mere worldling. He knew he was as\n      brave as any one, and never doubted his personal charm. Nevertheless,\n      neither the bravery nor the charm seemed to work very swiftly. Lieut.\n      Feraud&rsquo;s engaging, careless truculence of a beau sabreur underwent a\n      change. He began to make bitter allusions to &ldquo;clever fellows who stick at\n      nothing to get on.&rdquo; The army was full of them, he would say; you had only\n      to look round. But all the time he had in view one person only, his\n      adversary, D&rsquo;Hubert. Once he confided to an appreciative friend: &ldquo;You see,\n      I don&rsquo;t know how to fawn on the right sort of people. It isn&rsquo;t in my\n      character.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      He did not get his step till a week after Austerlitz. The Light Cavalry of\n      the Grand Army had its hands very full of interesting work for a little\n      while. Directly the pressure of professional occupation had been eased\n      Captain Feraud took measures to arrange a meeting without loss of time. &ldquo;I\n      know my bird,&rdquo; he observed, grimly. &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t look sharp he will take\n      care to get himself promoted over the heads of a dozen better men than\n      himself. He&rsquo;s got the knack for that sort of thing.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      This duel was fought in Silesia. If not fought to a finish, it was, at any\n      rate, fought to a standstill. The weapon was the cavalry sabre, and the\n      skill, the science, the vigour, and the determination displayed by the\n      adversaries compelled the admiration of the beholders. It became the\n      subject of talk on both shores of the Danube, and as far as the garrisons\n      of Gratz and Laybach. They crossed blades seven times. Both had many cuts\n      which bled profusely. Both refused to have the combat stopped, time after\n      time, with what appeared the most deadly animosity. This appearance was\n      caused on the part of Captain D&rsquo;Hubert by a rational desire to be done\n      once for all with this worry; on the part of Captain Feraud by a\n      tremendous exaltation of his pugnacious instincts and the incitement of\n      wounded vanity. At last, dishevelled, their shirts in rags, covered with\n      gore and hardly able to stand, they were led away forcibly by their\n      marvelling and horrified seconds. Later on, besieged by comrades avid of\n      details, these gentlemen declared that they could not have allowed that\n      sort of hacking to go on indefinitely. Asked whether the quarrel was\n      settled this time, they gave it out as their conviction that it was a\n      difference which could only be settled by one of the parties remaining\n      lifeless on the ground. The sensation spread from army corps to army\n      corps, and penetrated at last to the smallest detachments of the troops\n      cantoned between the Rhine and the Save. In the cafes in Vienna it was\n      generally estimated, from details to hand, that the adversaries would be\n      able to meet again in three weeks&rsquo; time on the outside. Something really\n      transcendent in the way of duelling was expected.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      These expectations were brought to naught by the necessities of the\n      service which separated the two officers. No official notice had been\n      taken of their quarrel. It was now the property of the army, and not to be\n      meddled with lightly. But the story of the duel, or rather their duelling\n      propensities, must have stood somewhat in the way of their advancement,\n      because they were still captains when they came together again during the\n      war with Prussia. Detached north after Jena, with the army commanded by\n      Marshal Bernadotte, Prince of Ponte Corvo, they entered Lubeck together.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      It was only after the occupation of that town that Captain Feraud found\n      leisure to consider his future conduct in view of the fact that Captain\n      D&rsquo;Hubert had been given the position of third aide-de-camp to the marshal.\n      He considered it a great part of a night, and in the morning summoned two\n      sympathetic friends.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking it over calmly,&rdquo; he said, gazing at them with\n      blood-shot, tired eyes. &ldquo;I see that I must get rid of that intriguing\n      personage. Here he&rsquo;s managed to sneak on to the personal staff of the\n      marshal. It&rsquo;s a direct provocation to me. I can&rsquo;t tolerate a situation in\n      which I am exposed any day to receive an order through him. And God knows\n      what order, too! That sort of thing has happened once before&mdash;and\n      that&rsquo;s once too often. He understands this perfectly, never fear. I can&rsquo;t\n      tell you any more. Now you know what it is you have to do.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      This encounter took place outside the town of Lubeck, on very open ground,\n      selected with special care in deference to the general sentiment of the\n      cavalry division belonging to the army corps, that this time the two\n      officers should meet on horseback. After all, this duel was a cavalry\n      affair, and to persist in fighting on foot would look like a slight on\n      one&rsquo;s own arm of the service. The seconds, startled by the unusual nature\n      of the suggestion, hastened to refer to their principals. Captain Feraud\n      jumped at it with alacrity. For some obscure reason, depending, no doubt,\n      on his psychology, he imagined himself invincible on horseback. All alone\n      within the four walls of his room he rubbed his hands and muttered\n      triumphantly, &ldquo;Aha! my pretty staff officer, I&rsquo;ve got you now.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Captain D&rsquo;Hubert on his side, after staring hard for a considerable time\n      at his friends, shrugged his shoulders slightly. This affair had\n      hopelessly and unreasonably complicated his existence for him. One\n      absurdity more or less in the development did not matter&mdash;all\n      absurdity was distasteful to him; but, urbane as ever, he produced a\n      faintly ironical smile, and said in his calm voice, &ldquo;It certainly will do\n      away to some extent with the monotony of the thing.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      When left alone, he sat down at a table and took his head into his hands.\n      He had not spared himself of late and the marshal had been working all his\n      aides-decamp particularly hard. The last three weeks of campaigning in\n      horrible weather had affected his health. When over-tired he suffered from\n      a stitch in his wounded side, and that uncomfortable sensation always\n      depressed him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s that brute&rsquo;s doing, too,&rdquo; he thought bitterly.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The day before he had received a letter from home, announcing that his\n      only sister was going to be married. He reflected that from the time she\n      was nineteen and he twenty-six, when he went away to garrison life in\n      Strasbourg, he had had but two short glimpses of her. They had been great\n      friends and confidants; and now she was going to be given away to a man\n      whom he did not know&mdash;a very worthy fellow no doubt, but not half\n      good enough for her. He would never see his old Leonie again. She had a\n      capable little head, and plenty of tact; she would know how to manage the\n      fellow, to be sure. He was easy in his mind about her happiness but he\n      felt ousted from the first place in her thoughts which had been his ever\n      since the girl could speak. A melancholy regret of the days of his\n      childhood settled upon Captain D&rsquo;Hubert, third aide-de-camp to the Prince\n      of Ponte Corvo.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He threw aside the letter of congratulation he had begun to write as in\n      duty bound, but without enthusiasm. He took a fresh piece of paper, and\n      traced on it the words: &ldquo;This is my last will and testament.&rdquo; Looking at\n      these words he gave himself up to unpleasant reflection; a presentiment\n      that he would never see the scenes of his childhood weighed down the\n      equable spirits of Captain D&rsquo;Hubert. He jumped up, pushing his chair back,\n      yawned elaborately in sign that he didn&rsquo;t care anything for presentiments,\n      and throwing himself on the bed went to sleep. During the night he\n      shivered from time to time without waking up. In the morning he rode out\n      of town between his two seconds, talking of indifferent things, and\n      looking right and left with apparent detachment into the heavy morning\n      mists shrouding the flat green fields bordered by hedges. He leaped a\n      ditch, and saw the forms of many mounted men moving in the fog. &ldquo;We are to\n      fight before a gallery, it seems,&rdquo; he muttered to himself, bitterly.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      His seconds were rather concerned at the state of the atmosphere, but\n      presently a pale, sickly sun struggled out of the low vapours, and Captain\n      D&rsquo;Hubert made out, in the distance, three horsemen riding a little apart\n      from the others. It was Captain Feraud and his seconds. He drew his sabre,\n      and assured himself that it was properly fastened to his wrist. And now\n      the seconds, who had been standing in close group with the heads of their\n      horses together, separated at an easy canter, leaving a large, clear field\n      between him and his adversary. Captain D&rsquo;Hubert looked at the pale sun, at\n      the dismal fields, and the imbecility of the impending fight filled him\n      with desolation. From a distant part of the field a stentorian voice\n      shouted commands at proper intervals: Au pas&mdash;Au trot&mdash;Charrrgez!\n      . . . Presentiments of death don&rsquo;t come to a man for nothing, he thought\n      at the very moment he put spurs to his horse.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      And therefore he was more than surprised when, at the very first set-to,\n      Captain Feraud laid himself open to a cut over the forehead, which\n      blinding him with blood, ended the combat almost before it had fairly\n      begun. It was impossible to go on. Captain D&rsquo;Hubert, leaving his enemy\n      swearing horribly and reeling in the saddle between his two appalled\n      friends, leaped the ditch again into the road and trotted home with his\n      two seconds, who seemed rather awestruck at the speedy issue of that\n      encounter. In the evening Captain D&rsquo;Hubert finished the congratulatory\n      letter on his sister&rsquo;s marriage.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He finished it late. It was a long letter. Captain D&rsquo;Hubert gave reins to\n      his fancy. He told his sister that he would feel rather lonely after this\n      great change in her life; but then the day would come for him, too, to get\n      married. In fact, he was thinking already of the time when there would be\n      no one left to fight with in Europe and the epoch of wars would be over.\n      &ldquo;I expect then,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;to be within measurable distance of a\n      marshal&rsquo;s baton, and you will be an experienced married woman. You shall\n      look out a wife for me. I will be, probably, bald by then, and a little\n      blase. I shall require a young girl, pretty of course, and with a large\n      fortune, which should help me to close my glorious career in the splendour\n      befitting my exalted rank.&rdquo; He ended with the information that he had just\n      given a lesson to a worrying, quarrelsome fellow who imagined he had a\n      grievance against him. &ldquo;But if you, in the depths of your province,&rdquo; he\n      continued, &ldquo;ever hear it said that your brother is of a quarrelsome\n      disposition, don&rsquo;t you believe it on any account. There is no saying what\n      gossip from the army may reach your innocent ears. Whatever you hear you\n      may rest assured that your ever-loving brother is not a duellist.&rdquo; Then\n      Captain D&rsquo;Hubert crumpled up the blank sheet of paper headed with the\n      words &ldquo;This is my last will and testament,&rdquo; and threw it in the fire with\n      a great laugh at himself. He didn&rsquo;t care a snap for what that lunatic\n      could do. He had suddenly acquired the conviction that his adversary was\n      utterly powerless to affect his life in any sort of way; except, perhaps,\n      in the way of putting a special excitement into the delightful, gay\n      intervals between the campaigns.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      From this on there were, however, to be no peaceful intervals in the\n      career of Captain D&rsquo;Hubert. He saw the fields of Eylau and Friedland,\n      marched and countermarched in the snow, in the mud, in the dust of Polish\n      plains, picking up distinction and advancement on all the roads of\n      North-eastern Europe. Meantime, Captain Feraud, despatched southwards with\n      his regiment, made unsatisfactory war in Spain. It was only when the\n      preparations for the Russian campaign began that he was ordered north\n      again. He left the country of mantillas and oranges without regret.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The first signs of a not unbecoming baldness added to the lofty aspect of\n      Colonel D&rsquo;Hubert&rsquo;s forehead. This feature was no longer white and smooth\n      as in the days of his youth; the kindly open glance of his blue eyes had\n      grown a little hard as if from much peering through the smoke of battles.\n      The ebony crop on Colonel Feraud&rsquo;s head, coarse and crinkly like a cap of\n      horsehair, showed many silver threads about the temples. A detestable\n      warfare of ambushes and inglorious surprises had not improved his temper.\n      The beak-like curve of his nose was unpleasantly set off by a deep fold on\n      each side of his mouth. The round orbits of his eyes radiated wrinkles.\n      More than ever he recalled an irritable and staring bird&mdash;something\n      like a cross between a parrot and an owl. He was still extremely outspoken\n      in his dislike of &ldquo;intriguing fellows.&rdquo; He seized every opportunity to\n      state that he did not pick up his rank in the ante-rooms of marshals. The\n      unlucky persons, civil or military, who, with an intention of being\n      pleasant, begged Colonel Feraud to tell them how he came by that very\n      apparent scar on the forehead, were astonished to find themselves snubbed\n      in various ways, some of which were simply rude and others mysteriously\n      sardonic. Young officers were warned kindly by their more experienced\n      comrades not to stare openly at the colonel&rsquo;s scar. But indeed an officer\n      need have been very young in his profession not to have heard the\n      legendary tale of that duel originating in a mysterious, unforgivable\n      offence.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      III\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The retreat from Moscow submerged all private feelings in a sea of\n      disaster and misery. Colonels without regiments, D&rsquo;Hubert and Feraud\n      carried the musket in the ranks of the so-called sacred battalion&mdash;a\n      battalion recruited from officers of all arms who had no longer any troops\n      to lead.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In that battalion promoted colonels did duty as sergeants; the generals\n      captained the companies; a marshal of France, Prince of the Empire,\n      commanded the whole. All had provided themselves with muskets picked up on\n      the road, and with cartridges taken from the dead. In the general\n      destruction of the bonds of discipline and duty holding together the\n      companies, the battalions, the regiments, the brigades, and divisions of\n      an armed host, this body of men put its pride in preserving some semblance\n      of order and formation. The only stragglers were those who fell out to\n      give up to the frost their exhausted souls. They plodded on, and their\n      passage did not disturb the mortal silence of the plains, shining with the\n      livid light of snows under a sky the colour of ashes. Whirlwinds ran along\n      the fields, broke against the dark column, enveloped it in a turmoil of\n      flying icicles, and subsided, disclosing it creeping on its tragic way\n      without the swing and rhythm of the military pace. It struggled onwards,\n      the men exchanging neither words nor looks; whole ranks marched touching\n      elbow, day after day and never raising their eyes from the ground, as if\n      lost in despairing reflections. In the dumb, black forests of pines the\n      cracking of overloaded branches was the only sound they heard. Often from\n      daybreak to dusk no one spoke in the whole column. It was like a macabre\n      march of struggling corpses towards a distant grave. Only an alarm of\n      Cossacks could restore to their eyes a semblance of martial resolution.\n      The battalion faced about and deployed, or formed square under the endless\n      fluttering of snowflakes. A cloud of horsemen with fur caps on their\n      heads, levelled long lances, and yelled &ldquo;Hurrah! Hurrah!&rdquo; around their\n      menacing immobility whence, with muffled detonations, hundreds of dark red\n      flames darted through the air thick with falling snow. In a very few\n      moments the horsemen would disappear, as if carried off yelling in the\n      gale, and the sacred battalion standing still, alone in the blizzard,\n      heard only the howling of the wind, whose blasts searched their very\n      hearts. Then, with a cry or two of &ldquo;Vive l&rsquo;Empereur!&rdquo; it would resume its\n      march, leaving behind a few lifeless bodies lying huddled up, tiny black\n      specks on the white immensity of the snows.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Though often marching in the ranks, or skirmishing in the woods side by\n      side, the two officers ignored each other; this not so much from inimical\n      intention as from a very real indifference. All their store of moral\n      energy was expended in resisting the terrific enmity of nature and the\n      crushing sense of irretrievable disaster. To the last they counted among\n      the most active, the least demoralized of the battalion; their vigorous\n      vitality invested them both with the appearance of an heroic pair in the\n      eyes of their comrades. And they never exchanged more than a casual word\n      or two, except one day, when skirmishing in front of the battalion against\n      a worrying attack of cavalry, they found themselves cut off in the woods\n      by a small party of Cossacks. A score of fur-capped, hairy horsemen rode\n      to and fro, brandishing their lances in ominous silence; but the two\n      officers had no mind to lay down their arms, and Colonel Feraud suddenly\n      spoke up in a hoarse, growling voice, bringing his firelock to the\n      shoulder. &ldquo;You take the nearest brute, Colonel D&rsquo;Hubert; I&rsquo;ll settle the\n      next one. I am a better shot than you are.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Colonel D&rsquo;Hubert nodded over his levelled musket. Their shoulders were\n      pressed against the trunk of a large tree; on their front enormous\n      snowdrifts protected them from a direct charge. Two carefully aimed shots\n      rang out in the frosty air, two Cossacks reeled in their saddles. The\n      rest, not thinking the game good enough, closed round their wounded\n      comrades and galloped away out of range. The two officers managed to\n      rejoin their battalion halted for the night. During that afternoon they\n      had leaned upon each other more than once, and towards the end, Colonel\n      D&rsquo;Hubert, whose long legs gave him an advantage in walking through soft\n      snow, peremptorily took the musket of Colonel Feraud from him and carried\n      it on his shoulder, using his own as a staff.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      On the outskirts of a village half buried in the snow an old wooden barn\n      burned with a clear and an immense flame. The sacred battalion of\n      skeletons, muffled in rags, crowded greedily the windward side, stretching\n      hundreds of numbed, bony hands to the blaze. Nobody had noted their\n      approach. Before entering the circle of light playing on the sunken,\n      glassy-eyed, starved faces, Colonel D&rsquo;Hubert spoke in his turn:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your musket, Colonel Feraud. I can walk better than you.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Colonel Feraud nodded, and pushed on towards the warmth of the fierce\n      flames. Colonel D&rsquo;Hubert was more deliberate, but not the less bent on\n      getting a place in the front rank. Those they shouldered aside tried to\n      greet with a faint cheer the reappearance of the two indomitable\n      companions in activity and endurance. Those manly qualities had never\n      perhaps received a higher tribute than this feeble acclamation.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      This is the faithful record of speeches exchanged during the retreat from\n      Moscow by Colonels Feraud and D&rsquo;Hubert. Colonel Feraud&rsquo;s taciturnity was\n      the outcome of concentrated rage. Short, hairy, black faced, with layers\n      of grime and the thick sprouting of a wiry beard, a frost-bitten hand\n      wrapped up in filthy rags carried in a sling, he accused fate of\n      unparalleled perfidy towards the sublime Man of Destiny. Colonel D&rsquo;Hubert,\n      his long moustaches pendent in icicles on each side of his cracked blue\n      lips, his eyelids inflamed with the glare of snows, the principal part of\n      his costume consisting of a sheepskin coat looted with difficulty from the\n      frozen corpse of a camp follower found in an abandoned cart, took a more\n      thoughtful view of events. His regularly handsome features, now reduced to\n      mere bony lines and fleshless hollows, looked out of a woman&rsquo;s black\n      velvet hood, over which was rammed forcibly a cocked hat picked up under\n      the wheels of an empty army fourgon, which must have contained at one time\n      some general officer&rsquo;s luggage. The sheepskin coat being short for a man\n      of his inches ended very high up, and the skin of his legs, blue with the\n      cold, showed through the tatters of his nether garments. This under the\n      circumstances provoked neither jeers nor pity. No one cared how the next\n      man felt or looked. Colonel D&rsquo;Hubert himself, hardened to exposure,\n      suffered mainly in his self-respect from the lamentable indecency of his\n      costume. A thoughtless person may think that with a whole host of\n      inanimate bodies bestrewing the path of retreat there could not have been\n      much difficulty in supplying the deficiency. But to loot a pair of\n      breeches from a frozen corpse is not so easy as it may appear to a mere\n      theorist. It requires time and labour. You must remain behind while your\n      companions march on. Colonel D&rsquo;Hubert had his scruples as to falling out.\n      Once he had stepped aside he could not be sure of ever rejoining his\n      battalion; and the ghastly intimacy of a wrestling match with the frozen\n      dead opposing the unyielding rigidity of iron to your violence was\n      repugnant to the delicacy of his feelings. Luckily, one day, grubbing in a\n      mound of snow between the huts of a village in the hope of finding there a\n      frozen potato or some vegetable garbage he could put between his long and\n      shaky teeth, Colonel D&rsquo;Hubert uncovered a couple of mats of the sort\n      Russian peasants use to line the sides of their carts with. These, beaten\n      free of frozen snow, bent about his elegant person and fastened solidly\n      round his waist, made a bell-shaped nether garment, a sort of stiff\n      petticoat, which rendered Colonel D&rsquo;Hubert a perfectly decent, but a much\n      more noticeable figure than before.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Thus accoutred, he continued to retreat, never doubting of his personal\n      escape, but full of other misgivings. The early buoyancy of his belief in\n      the future was destroyed. If the road of glory led through such unforeseen\n      passages, he asked himself&mdash;for he was reflective&mdash;whether the\n      guide was altogether trustworthy. It was a patriotic sadness, not\n      unmingled with some personal concern, and quite unlike the unreasoning\n      indignation against men and things nursed by Colonel Feraud. Recruiting\n      his strength in a little German town for three weeks, Colonel D&rsquo;Hubert was\n      surprised to discover within himself a love of repose. His returning\n      vigour was strangely pacific in its aspirations. He meditated silently\n      upon this bizarre change of mood. No doubt many of his brother officers of\n      field rank went through the same moral experience. But these were not the\n      times to talk of it. In one of his letters home Colonel D&rsquo;Hubert wrote,\n      &ldquo;All your plans, my dear Leonie, for marrying me to the charming girl you\n      have discovered in your neighbourhood, seem farther off than ever. Peace\n      is not yet. Europe wants another lesson. It will be a hard task for us,\n      but it shall be done, because the Emperor is invincible.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Thus wrote Colonel D &lsquo;Hubert from Pomerania to his married sister Leonie,\n      settled in the south of France. And so far the sentiments expressed would\n      not have been disowned by Colonel Feraud, who wrote no letters to anybody,\n      whose father had been in life an illiterate blacksmith, who had no sister\n      or brother, and whom no one desired ardently to pair off for a life of\n      peace with a charming young girl. But Colonel D &lsquo;Hubert&rsquo;s letter contained\n      also some philosophical generalities upon the uncertainty of all personal\n      hopes, when bound up entirely with the prestigious fortune of one\n      incomparably great it is true, yet still remaining but a man in his\n      greatness. This view would have appeared rank heresy to Colonel Feraud.\n      Some melancholy forebodings of a military kind, expressed cautiously,\n      would have been pronounced as nothing short of high treason by Colonel\n      Feraud. But Leonie, the sister of Colonel D&rsquo;Hubert, read them with\n      profound satisfaction, and, folding the letter thoughtfully, remarked to\n      herself that &ldquo;Armand was likely to prove eventually a sensible fellow.&rdquo;\n       Since her marriage into a Southern family she had become a convinced\n      believer in the return of the legitimate king. Hopeful and anxious she\n      offered prayers night and morning, and burnt candles in churches for the\n      safety and prosperity of her brother.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      She had every reason to suppose that her prayers were heard. Colonel\n      D&rsquo;Hubert passed through Lutzen, Bautzen, and Leipsic losing no limb, and\n      acquiring additional reputation. Adapting his conduct to the needs of that\n      desperate time, he had never voiced his misgivings. He concealed them\n      under a cheerful courtesy of such pleasant character that people were\n      inclined to ask themselves with wonder whether Colonel D&rsquo;Hubert was aware\n      of any disasters. Not only his manners, but even his glances remained\n      untroubled. The steady amenity of his blue eyes disconcerted all\n      grumblers, and made despair itself pause.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      This bearing was remarked favourably by the Emperor himself; for Colonel\n      D&rsquo;Hubert, attached now to the Major-General&rsquo;s staff, came on several\n      occasions under the imperial eye. But it exasperated the higher strung\n      nature of Colonel Feraud. Passing through Magdeburg on service, this last\n      allowed himself, while seated gloomily at dinner with the Commandant de\n      Place, to say of his life-long adversary: &ldquo;This man does not love the\n      Emperor,&rdquo; and his words were received by the other guests in profound\n      silence. Colonel Feraud, troubled in his conscience at the atrocity of the\n      aspersion, felt the need to back it up by a good argument. &ldquo;I ought to\n      know him,&rdquo; he cried, adding some oaths. &ldquo;One studies one&rsquo;s adversary. I\n      have met him on the ground half a dozen times, as all the army knows. What\n      more do you want? If that isn&rsquo;t opportunity enough for any fool to size up\n      his man, may the devil take me if I can tell what is.&rdquo; And he looked\n      around the table, obstinate and sombre.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Later on in Paris, while extremely busy reorganizing his regiment, Colonel\n      Feraud learned that Colonel D&rsquo;Hubert had been made a general. He glared at\n      his informant incredulously, then folded his arms and turned away\n      muttering, &ldquo;Nothing surprises me on the part of that man.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      And aloud he added, speaking over his shoulder, &ldquo;You would oblige me\n      greatly by telling General D&rsquo;Hubert at the first opportunity that his\n      advancement saves him for a time from a pretty hot encounter. I was only\n      waiting for him to turn up here.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The other officer remonstrated.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Could you think of it, Colonel Feraud, at this time, when every life\n      should be consecrated to the glory and safety of France?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      But the strain of unhappiness caused by military reverses had spoiled\n      Colonel Feraud&rsquo;s character. Like many other men, he was rendered wicked by\n      misfortune.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I cannot consider General D&rsquo;Hubert&rsquo;s existence of any account either for\n      the glory or safety of France,&rdquo; he snapped viciously. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t pretend,\n      perhaps, to know him better than I do&mdash;I who have met him half a\n      dozen times on the ground&mdash;do you?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      His interlocutor, a young man, was silenced. Colonel Feraud walked up and\n      down the room.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;This is not the time to mince matters,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that\n      that man ever loved the Emperor. He picked up his general&rsquo;s stars under\n      the boots of Marshal Berthier. Very well. I&rsquo;ll get mine in another\n      fashion, and then we shall settle this business which has been dragging on\n      too long.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      General D&rsquo;Hubert, informed indirectly of Colonel Feraud&rsquo;s attitude, made a\n      gesture as if to put aside an importunate person. His thoughts were\n      solicited by graver cares. He had had no time to go and see his family.\n      His sister, whose royalist hopes were rising higher every day, though\n      proud of her brother, regretted his recent advancement in a measure,\n      because it put on him a prominent mark of the usurper&rsquo;s favour, which\n      later on could have an adverse influence upon his career. He wrote to her\n      that no one but an inveterate enemy could say he had got his promotion by\n      favour. As to his career, he assured her that he looked no farther forward\n      into the future than the next battlefield.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Beginning the campaign of France in this dogged spirit, General D&rsquo;Hubert\n      was wounded on the second day of the battle under Laon. While being\n      carried off the field he heard that Colonel Feraud, promoted this moment\n      to general, had been sent to replace him at the head of his brigade. He\n      cursed his luck impulsively, not being able at the first glance to discern\n      all the advantages of a nasty wound. And yet it was by this heroic method\n      that Providence was shaping his future. Travelling slowly south to his\n      sister&rsquo;s country home under the care of a trusty old servant, General\n      D&rsquo;Hubert was spared the humiliating contacts and the perplexities of\n      conduct which assailed the men of Napoleonic empire at the moment of its\n      downfall. Lying in his bed, with the windows of his room open wide to the\n      sunshine of Provence, he perceived the undisguised aspect of the blessing\n      conveyed by that jagged fragment of a Prussian shell, which, killing his\n      horse and ripping open his thigh, saved him from an active conflict with\n      his conscience. After the last fourteen years spent sword in hand in the\n      saddle, and with the sense of his duty done to the very end, General\n      D&rsquo;Hubert found resignation an easy virtue. His sister was delighted with\n      his reasonableness. &ldquo;I leave myself altogether in your hands, my dear\n      Leonie,&rdquo; he had said to her.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He was still laid up when, the credit of his brother-in-law&rsquo;s family being\n      exerted on his behalf, he received from the royal government not only the\n      confirmation of his rank, but the assurance of being retained on the\n      active list. To this was added an unlimited convalescent leave. The\n      unfavourable opinion entertained of him in Bonapartist circles, though it\n      rested on nothing more solid than the unsupported pronouncement of General\n      Feraud, was directly responsible for General D&rsquo;Hubert&rsquo;s retention on the\n      active list. As to General Feraud, his rank was confirmed, too. It was\n      more than he dared to expect; but Marshal Soult, then Minister of War to\n      the restored king, was partial to officers who had served in Spain. Only\n      not even the marshal&rsquo;s protection could secure for him active employment.\n      He remained irreconcilable, idle, and sinister. He sought in obscure\n      restaurants the company of other half-pay officers who cherished dingy but\n      glorious old tricolour cockades in their breast-pockets, and buttoned with\n      the forbidden eagle buttons their shabby uniforms, declaring themselves\n      too poor to afford the expense of the prescribed change.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The triumphant return from Elba, an historical fact as marvellous and\n      incredible as the exploits of some mythological demi-god, found General\n      D&rsquo;Hubert still quite unable to sit a horse. Neither could he walk very\n      well. These disabilities, which Madame Leonie accounted most lucky, helped\n      to keep her brother out of all possible mischief. His frame of mind at\n      that time, she noted with dismay, became very far from reasonable. This\n      general officer, still menaced by the loss of a limb, was discovered one\n      night in the stables of the chateau by a groom, who, seeing a light,\n      raised an alarm of thieves. His crutch was lying half-buried in the straw\n      of the litter, and the general was hopping on one leg in a loose box\n      around a snorting horse he was trying to saddle. Such were the effects of\n      imperial magic upon a calm temperament and a pondered mind. Beset in the\n      light of stable lanterns, by the tears, entreaties, indignation,\n      remonstrances and reproaches of his family, he got out of the difficult\n      situation by fainting away there and then in the arms of his nearest\n      relatives, and was carried off to bed. Before he got out of it again, the\n      second reign of Napoleon, the Hundred Days of feverish agitation and\n      supreme effort, passed away like a terrifying dream. The tragic year 1815,\n      begun in the trouble and unrest of consciences, was ending in vengeful\n      proscriptions.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      How General Feraud escaped the clutches of the Special Commission and the\n      last offices of a firing squad he never knew himself. It was partly due to\n      the subordinate position he was assigned during the Hundred Days. The\n      Emperor had never given him active command, but had kept him busy at the\n      cavalry depot in Paris, mounting and despatching hastily drilled troopers\n      into the field. Considering this task as unworthy of his abilities, he had\n      discharged it with no offensively noticeable zeal; but for the greater\n      part he was saved from the excesses of Royalist reaction by the\n      interference of General D&rsquo;Hubert.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      This last, still on convalescent leave, but able now to travel, had been\n      despatched by his sister to Paris to present himself to his legitimate\n      sovereign. As no one in the capital could possibly know anything of the\n      episode in the stable he was received there with distinction. Military to\n      the very bottom of his soul, the prospect of rising in his profession\n      consoled him from finding himself the butt of Bonapartist malevolence,\n      which pursued him with a persistence he could not account for. All the\n      rancour of that embittered and persecuted party pointed to him as the man\n      who had never loved the Emperor&mdash;a sort of monster essentially worse\n      than a mere betrayer.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      General D&rsquo;Hubert shrugged his shoulders without anger at this ferocious\n      prejudice. Rejected by his old friends, and mistrusting profoundly the\n      advances of Royalist society, the young and handsome general (he was\n      barely forty) adopted a manner of cold, punctilious courtesy, which at the\n      merest shadow of an intended slight passed easily into harsh haughtiness.\n      Thus prepared, General D&rsquo;Hubert went about his affairs in Paris feeling\n      inwardly very happy with the peculiar uplifting happiness of a man very\n      much in love. The charming girl looked out by his sister had come upon the\n      scene, and had conquered him in the thorough manner in which a young girl\n      by merely existing in his sight can make a man of forty her own. They were\n      going to be married as soon as General D&rsquo;Hubert had obtained his official\n      nomination to a promised command.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      One afternoon, sitting on the terrasse of the Cafe Tortoni, General\n      D&rsquo;Hubert learned from the conversation of two strangers occupying a table\n      near his own, that General Feraud, included in the batch of superior\n      officers arrested after the second return of the king, was in danger of\n      passing before the Special Commission. Living all his spare moments, as is\n      frequently the case with expectant lovers, a day in advance of reality,\n      and in a state of bestarred hallucination, it required nothing less than\n      the name of his perpetual antagonist pronounced in a loud voice to call\n      the youngest of Napoleon&rsquo;s generals away from the mental contemplation of\n      his betrothed. He looked round. The strangers wore civilian clothes. Lean\n      and weather-beaten, lolling back in their chairs, they scowled at people\n      with moody and defiant abstraction from under their hats pulled low over\n      their eyes. It was not difficult to recognize them for two of the\n      compulsorily retired officers of the Old Guard. As from bravado or\n      carelessness they chose to speak in loud tones, General D&rsquo;Hubert, who saw\n      no reason why he should change his seat, heard every word. They did not\n      seem to be the personal friends of General Feraud. His name came up\n      amongst others. Hearing it repeated, General D&rsquo;Hubert&rsquo;s tender\n      anticipations of a domestic future adorned with a woman&rsquo;s grace were\n      traversed by the harsh regret of his warlike past, of that one long,\n      intoxicating clash of arms, unique in the magnitude of its glory and\n      disaster&mdash;the marvellous work and the special possession of his own\n      generation. He felt an irrational tenderness towards his old adversary and\n      appreciated emotionally the murderous absurdity their encounter had\n      introduced into his life. It was like an additional pinch of spice in a\n      hot dish. He remembered the flavour with sudden melancholy. He would never\n      taste it again. It was all over. &ldquo;I fancy it was being left lying in the\n      garden that had exasperated him so against me from the first,&rdquo; he thought,\n      indulgently.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The two strangers at the next table had fallen silent after the third\n      mention of General Feraud&rsquo;s name. Presently the elder of the two, speaking\n      again in a bitter tone, affirmed that General Feraud&rsquo;s account was\n      settled. And why? Simply because he was not like some bigwigs who loved\n      only themselves. The Royalists knew they could never make anything of him.\n      He loved The Other too well.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The Other was the Man of St. Helena. The two officers nodded and touched\n      glasses before they drank to an impossible return. Then the same who had\n      spoken before, remarked with a sardonic laugh, &ldquo;His adversary showed more\n      cleverness.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;What adversary?&rdquo; asked the younger, as if puzzled.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know? They were two hussars. At each promotion they fought a\n      duel. Haven&rsquo;t you heard of the duel going on ever since 1801?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The other had heard of the duel, of course. Now he understood the\n      allusion. General Baron D&rsquo;Hubert would be able now to enjoy his fat king&rsquo;s\n      favour in peace.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Much good may it do to him,&rdquo; mumbled the elder. &ldquo;They were both brave\n      men. I never saw this D&rsquo;Hubert&mdash;a sort of intriguing dandy, I am\n      told. But I can well believe what I&rsquo;ve heard Feraud say of him&mdash;that\n      he never loved the Emperor.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      They rose and went away.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      General D&rsquo;Hubert experienced the horror of a somnambulist who wakes up\n      from a complacent dream of activity to find himself walking on a quagmire.\n      A profound disgust of the ground on which he was making his way overcame\n      him. Even the image of the charming girl was swept from his view in the\n      flood of moral distress. Everything he had ever been or hoped to be would\n      taste of bitter ignominy unless he could manage to save General Feraud\n      from the fate which threatened so many braves. Under the impulse of this\n      almost morbid need to attend to the safety of his adversary, General\n      D&rsquo;Hubert worked so well with hands and feet (as the French saying is),\n      that in less than twenty-four hours he found means of obtaining an\n      extraordinary private audience from the Minister of Police.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      General Baron D&rsquo;Hubert was shown in suddenly without preliminaries. In the\n      dusk of the Minister&rsquo;s cabinet, behind the forms of writing-desk, chairs,\n      and tables, between two bunches of wax candles blazing in sconces, he\n      beheld a figure in a gorgeous coat posturing before a tall mirror. The old\n      conventionnel Fouche, Senator of the Empire, traitor to every man, to\n      every principle and motive of human conduct. Duke of Otranto, and the wily\n      artizan of the second Restoration, was trying the fit of a court suit in\n      which his young and accomplished fiancee had declared her intention to\n      have his portrait painted on porcelain. It was a caprice, a charming fancy\n      which the first Minister of Police of the second Restoration was anxious\n      to gratify. For that man, often compared in wiliness of conduct to a fox,\n      but whose ethical side could be worthily symbolized by nothing less\n      emphatic than a skunk, was as much possessed by his love as General\n      D&rsquo;Hubert himself.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Startled to be discovered thus by the blunder of a servant, he met this\n      little vexation with the characteristic impudence which had served his\n      turn so well in the endless intrigues of his self-seeking career. Without\n      altering his attitude a hair&rsquo;s-breadth, one leg in a silk stocking\n      advanced, his head twisted over his left shoulder, he called out calmly,\n      &ldquo;This way, General. Pray approach. Well? I am all attention.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      While General D&rsquo;Hubert, ill at ease as if one of his own little weaknesses\n      had been exposed, presented his request as shortly as possible, the Duke\n      of Otranto went on feeling the fit of his collar, settling the lapels\n      before the glass, and buckling his back in an effort to behold the set of\n      the gold embroidered coat-skirts behind. His still face, his attentive\n      eyes, could not have expressed a more complete interest in those matters\n      if he had been alone.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Exclude from the operations of the Special Court a certain Feraud,\n      Gabriel Florian, General of brigade of the promotion of 1814?&rdquo; he\n      repeated, in a slightly wondering tone, and then turned away from the\n      glass. &ldquo;Why exclude him precisely?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I am surprised that your Excellency, so competent in the evaluation of\n      men of his time, should have thought worth while to have that name put\n      down on the list.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;A rabid Bonapartist!&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;So is every grenadier and every trooper of the army, as your Excellency\n      well knows. And the individuality of General Feraud can have no more\n      weight than that of any casual grenadier. He is a man of no mental grasp,\n      of no capacity whatever. It is inconceivable that he should ever have any\n      influence.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He has a well-hung tongue, though,&rdquo; interjected Fouche.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Noisy, I admit, but not dangerous.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I will not dispute with you. I know next to nothing of him. Hardly his\n      name, in fact.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;And yet your Excellency has the presidency of the Commission charged by\n      the king to point out those who were to be tried,&rdquo; said General D&rsquo;Hubert,\n      with an emphasis which did not miss the minister&rsquo;s ear.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Yes, General,&rdquo; he said, walking away into the dark part of the vast room,\n      and throwing himself into a deep armchair that swallowed him up, all but\n      the soft gleam of gold embroideries and the pallid patch of the face&mdash;&ldquo;yes,\n      General. Take this chair there.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      General D&rsquo;Hubert sat down.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Yes, General,&rdquo; continued the arch-master in the arts of intrigue and\n      betrayals, whose duplicity, as if at times intolerable to his\n      self-knowledge, found relief in bursts of cynical openness. &ldquo;I did hurry\n      on the formation of the proscribing Commission, and I took its presidency.\n      And do you know why? Simply from fear that if I did not take it quickly\n      into my hands my own name would head the list of the proscribed. Such are\n      the times in which we live. But I am minister of the king yet, and I ask\n      you plainly why I should take the name of this obscure Feraud off the\n      list? You wonder how his name got there! Is it possible that you should\n      know men so little? My dear General, at the very first sitting of the\n      Commission names poured on us like rain off the roof of the Tuileries.\n      Names! We had our choice of thousands. How do you know that the name of\n      this Feraud, whose life or death don&rsquo;t matter to France, does not keep out\n      some other name?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The voice out of the armchair stopped. Opposite General D&rsquo;Hubert sat\n      still, shadowy and silent. Only his sabre clinked slightly. The voice in\n      the armchair began again. &ldquo;And we must try to satisfy the exigencies of\n      the Allied Sovereigns, too. The Prince de Talleyrand told me only\n      yesterday that Nesselrode had informed him officially of His Majesty the\n      Emperor Alexander&rsquo;s dissatisfaction at the small number of examples the\n      Government of the king intends to make&mdash;especially amongst military\n      men. I tell you this confidentially.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Upon my word!&rdquo; broke out General D&rsquo;Hubert, speaking through his teeth,\n      &ldquo;if your Excellency deigns to favour me with any more confidential\n      information I don&rsquo;t know what I will do. It&rsquo;s enough to break one&rsquo;s sword\n      over one&rsquo;s knee, and fling the pieces. . . .&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;What government you imagined yourself to be serving?&rdquo; interrupted the\n      minister, sharply.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      After a short pause the crestfallen voice of General D&rsquo;Hubert answered,\n      &ldquo;The Government of France.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s paying your conscience off with mere words, General. The truth is\n      that you are serving a government of returned exiles, of men who have been\n      without country for twenty years. Of men also who have just got over a\n      very bad and humiliating fright. . . . Have no illusions on that score.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The Duke of Otranto ceased. He had relieved himself, and had attained his\n      object of stripping some self-respect off that man who had inconveniently\n      discovered him posturing in a gold-embroidered court costume before a\n      mirror. But they were a hot-headed lot in the army; it occurred to him\n      that it would be inconvenient if a well-disposed general officer, received\n      in audience on the recommendation of one of the Princes, were to do\n      something rashly scandalous directly after a private interview with the\n      minister. In a changed tone he put a question to the point: &ldquo;Your relation&mdash;this\n      Feraud?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;No. No relation at all.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Intimate friend?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Intimate . . . yes. There is between us an intimate connection of a\n      nature which makes it a point of honour with me to try . . .&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The minister rang a bell without waiting for the end of the phrase. When\n      the servant had gone out, after bringing in a pair of heavy silver\n      candelabra for the writing-desk, the Duke of Otranto rose, his breast\n      glistening all over with gold in the strong light, and taking a piece of\n      paper out of a drawer, held it in his hand ostentatiously while he said\n      with persuasive gentleness: &ldquo;You must not speak of breaking your sword\n      across your knee, General. Perhaps you would never get another. The\n      Emperor will not return this time. . . . Diable d&rsquo;homme! There was just a\n      moment, here in Paris, soon after Waterloo, when he frightened me. It\n      looked as though he were ready to begin all over again. Luckily one never\n      does begin all over again, really. You must not think of breaking your\n      sword, General.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      General D&rsquo;Hubert, looking on the ground, moved slightly his hand in a\n      hopeless gesture of renunciation. The Minister of Police turned his eyes\n      away from him, and scanned deliberately the paper he had been holding up\n      all the time.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;There are only twenty general officers selected to be made an example of.\n      Twenty. A round number. And let&rsquo;s see, Feraud. . . . Ah, he&rsquo;s there.\n      Gabriel Florian. Parfaitement. That&rsquo;s your man. Well, there will be only\n      nineteen examples made now.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      General D&rsquo;Hubert stood up feeling as though he had gone through an\n      infectious illness. &ldquo;I must beg your Excellency to keep my interference a\n      profound secret. I attach the greatest importance to his never learning .\n      . .&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Who is going to inform him, I should like to know?&rdquo; said Fouche, raising\n      his eyes curiously to General D&rsquo;Hubert&rsquo;s tense, set face. &ldquo;Take one of\n      these pens, and run it through the name yourself. This is the only list in\n      existence. If you are careful to take up enough ink no one will be able to\n      tell what was the name struck out. But, par exemple, I am not responsible\n      for what Clarke will do with him afterwards. If he persists in being rabid\n      he will be ordered by the Minister of War to reside in some provincial\n      town under the supervision of the police.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      A few days later General D&rsquo;Hubert was saying to his sister, after the\n      first greetings had been got over: &ldquo;Ah, my dear Leonie! it seemed to me I\n      couldn&rsquo;t get away from Paris quick enough.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Effect of love,&rdquo; she suggested, with a malicious smile.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;And horror,&rdquo; added General D&rsquo;Hubert, with profound seriousness. &ldquo;I have\n      nearly died there of . . . of nausea.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      His face was contracted with disgust. And as his sister looked at him\n      attentively he continued, &ldquo;I have had to see Fouche. I have had an\n      audience. I have been in his cabinet. There remains with one, who had the\n      misfortune to breathe the air of the same room with that man, a sense of\n      diminished dignity, an uneasy feeling of being not so clean, after all, as\n      one hoped one was. . . . But you can&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      She nodded quickly several times. She understood very well, on the\n      contrary. She knew her brother thoroughly, and liked him as he was.\n      Moreover, the scorn and loathing of mankind were the lot of the Jacobin\n      Fouche, who, exploiting for his own advantage every weakness, every\n      virtue, every generous illusion of mankind, made dupes of his whole\n      generation, and died obscurely as Duke of Otranto.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;My dear Armand,&rdquo; she said, compassionately, &ldquo;what could you want from\n      that man?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Nothing less than a life,&rdquo; answered General D&rsquo;Hubert. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve got it.\n      It had to be done. But I feel yet as if I could never forgive the\n      necessity to the man I had to save.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      General Feraud, totally unable (as is the case with most of us) to\n      comprehend what was happening to him, received the Minister of War&rsquo;s order\n      to proceed at once to a small town of Central France with feelings whose\n      natural expression consisted in a fierce rolling of the eye and savage\n      grinding of the teeth. The passing away of the state of war, the only\n      condition of society he had ever known, the horrible view of a world at\n      peace, frightened him. He went away to his little town firmly convinced\n      that this could not last. There he was informed of his retirement from the\n      army, and that his pension (calculated on the scale of a colonel&rsquo;s rank)\n      was made dependent on the correctness of his conduct, and on the good\n      reports of the police. No longer in the army! He felt suddenly strange to\n      the earth, like a disembodied spirit. It was impossible to exist. But at\n      first he reacted from sheer incredulity. This could not be. He waited for\n      thunder, earthquakes, natural cataclysms; but nothing happened. The leaden\n      weight of an irremediable idleness descended upon General Feraud, who\n      having no resources within himself sank into a state of awe-inspiring\n      hebetude. He haunted the streets of the little town, gazing before him\n      with lacklustre eyes, disregarding the hats raised on his passage; and\n      people, nudging each other as he went by, whispered, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s poor General\n      Feraud. His heart is broken. Behold how he loved the Emperor.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The other living wreckage of Napoleonic tempest clustered round General\n      Feraud with infinite respect. He, himself, imagined his soul to be crushed\n      by grief. He suffered from quickly succeeding impulses to weep, to howl,\n      to bite his fists till blood came, to spend days on his bed with his head\n      thrust under the pillow; but these arose from sheer ennui, from the\n      anguish of an immense, indescribable, inconceivable boredom. His mental\n      inability to grasp the hopeless nature of his case as a whole saved him\n      from suicide. He never even thought of it once. He thought of nothing. But\n      his appetite abandoned him, and the difficulty he experienced to express\n      the overwhelming nature of his feelings (the most furious swearing could\n      do no justice to it) induced gradually a habit of silence&mdash;a sort of\n      death to a southern temperament.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Great, therefore, was the sensation amongst the anciens militaires\n      frequenting a certain little cafe; full of flies when one stuffy afternoon\n      &ldquo;that poor General Feraud&rdquo; let out suddenly a volley of formidable curses.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He had been sitting quietly in his own privileged corner looking through\n      the Paris gazettes with just as much interest as a condemned man on the\n      eve of execution could be expected to show in the news of the day. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll\n      find out presently that I am alive yet,&rdquo; he declared, in a dogmatic tone.\n      &ldquo;However, this is a private affair. An old affair of honour. Bah! Our\n      honour does not matter. Here we are driven off with a split ear like a lot\n      of cast troop horses&mdash;good only for a knacker&rsquo;s yard. But it would be\n      like striking a blow for the Emperor. . . . Messieurs, I shall require the\n      assistance of two of you.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Every man moved forward. General Feraud, deeply touched by this\n      demonstration, called with visible emotion upon the one-eyed veteran\n      cuirassier and the officer of the Chasseurs a Cheval who had left the tip\n      of his nose in Russia. He excused his choice to the others.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;A cavalry affair this&mdash;you know.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      He was answered with a varied chorus of &ldquo;Parfaitement, mon General . . . .\n      C&rsquo;est juste. . . . Parbleu, c&rsquo;est connu. . . .&rdquo; Everybody was satisfied.\n      The three left the cafe together, followed by cries of &ldquo;Bonne chance.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Outside they linked arms, the general in the middle. The three rusty\n      cocked hats worn en bataille with a sinister forward slant barred the\n      narrow street nearly right across. The overheated little town of grey\n      stones and red tiles was drowsing away its provincial afternoon under a\n      blue sky. The loud blows of a cooper hooping a cask reverberated regularly\n      between the houses. The general dragged his left foot a little in the\n      shade of the walls.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;This damned winter of 1813 has got into my bones for good. Never mind. We\n      must take pistols, that&rsquo;s all. A little lumbago. We must have pistols.\n      He&rsquo;s game for my bag. My eyes are as keen as ever. You should have seen me\n      in Russia picking off the dodging Cossacks with a beastly old infantry\n      musket. I have a natural gift for firearms.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      In this strain General Feraud ran on, holding up his head, with owlish\n      eyes and rapacious beak. A mere fighter all his life, a cavalry man, a\n      sabreur, he conceived war with the utmost simplicity, as, in the main, a\n      massed lot of personal contests, a sort of gregarious duelling. And here\n      he had in hand a war of his own. He revived. The shadow of peace passed\n      away from him like the shadow of death. It was the marvellous resurrection\n      of the named Feraud, Gabriel Florian, engage volontaire of 1793, General\n      of 1814, buried without ceremony by means of a service order signed by the\n      War Minister of the Second Restoration.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      IV\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      No man succeeds in everything he undertakes. In that sense we are all\n      failures. The great point is not to fail in ordering and sustaining the\n      effort of our life. In this matter vanity is what leads us astray. It\n      hurries us into situations from which we must come out damaged; whereas\n      pride is our safeguard, by the reserve it imposes on the choice of our\n      endeavour as much as by the virtue of its sustaining power.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      General D&rsquo;Hubert was proud and reserved. He had not been damaged by his\n      casual love affairs, successful or otherwise. In his war-scarred body his\n      heart at forty remained unscratched. Entering with reserve into his\n      sister&rsquo;s matrimonial plans, he had felt himself falling irremediably in\n      love as one falls off a roof. He was too proud to be frightened. Indeed,\n      the sensation was too delightful to be alarming.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The inexperience of a man of forty is a much more serious thing than the\n      inexperience of a youth of twenty, for it is not helped out by the\n      rashness of hot blood. The girl was mysterious, as young girls are by the\n      mere effect of their guarded ingenuity; and to him the mysteriousness of\n      that young girl appeared exceptional and fascinating. But there was\n      nothing mysterious about the arrangements of the match which Madame Leonie\n      had promoted. There was nothing peculiar, either. It was a very\n      appropriate match, commending itself extremely to the young lady&rsquo;s mother\n      (the father was dead) and tolerable to the young lady&rsquo;s uncle&mdash;an old\n      emigre lately returned from Germany, and pervading, cane in hand, a lean\n      ghost of the ancien regime, the garden walks of the young lady&rsquo;s ancestral\n      home.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      General D&rsquo;Hubert was not the man to be satisfied merely with the woman and\n      the fortune&mdash;when it came to the point. His pride (and pride aims\n      always at true success) would be satisfied with nothing short of love. But\n      as true pride excludes vanity, he could not imagine any reason why this\n      mysterious creature with deep and brilliant eyes of a violet colour should\n      have any feeling for him warmer than indifference. The young lady (her\n      name was Adele) baffled every attempt at a clear understanding on that\n      point. It is true that the attempts were clumsy and made timidly, because\n      by then General D&rsquo;Hubert had become acutely aware of the number of his\n      years, of his wounds, of his many moral imperfections, of his secret\n      unworthiness&mdash;and had incidentally learned by experience the meaning\n      of the word funk. As far as he could make out she seemed to imply that,\n      with an unbounded confidence in her mother&rsquo;s affection and sagacity, she\n      felt no unsurmountable dislike for the person of General D&rsquo;Hubert; and\n      that this was quite sufficient for a well-brought-up young lady to begin\n      married life upon. This view hurt and tormented the pride of General\n      D&rsquo;Hubert. And yet he asked himself, with a sort of sweet despair, what\n      more could he expect? She had a quiet and luminous forehead. Her violet\n      eyes laughed while the lines of her lips and chin remained composed in\n      admirable gravity. All this was set off by such a glorious mass of fair\n      hair, by a complexion so marvellous, by such a grace of expression, that\n      General D&rsquo;Hubert really never found the opportunity to examine with\n      sufficient detachment the lofty exigencies of his pride. In fact, he\n      became shy of that line of inquiry since it had led once or twice to a\n      crisis of solitary passion in which it was borne upon him that he loved\n      her enough to kill her rather than lose her. From such passages, not\n      unknown to men of forty, he would come out broken, exhausted, remorseful,\n      a little dismayed. He derived, however, considerable comfort from the\n      quietist practice of sitting now and then half the night by an open window\n      and meditating upon the wonder of her existence, like a believer lost in\n      the mystic contemplation of his faith.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      It must not be supposed that all these variations of his inward state were\n      made manifest to the world. General D &lsquo;Hubert found no difficulty in\n      appearing wreathed in smiles. Because, in fact, he was very happy. He\n      followed the established rules of his condition, sending over flowers\n      (from his sister&rsquo;s garden and hot-houses) early every morning, and a\n      little later following himself to lunch with his intended, her mother, and\n      her emigre uncle. The middle of the day was spent in strolling or sitting\n      in the shade. A watchful deference, trembling on the verge of tenderness\n      was the note of their intercourse on his side&mdash;with a playful turn of\n      the phrase concealing the profound trouble of his whole being caused by\n      her inaccessible nearness. Late in the afternoon General D &lsquo;Hubert walked\n      home between the fields of vines, sometimes intensely miserable, sometimes\n      supremely happy, sometimes pensively sad; but always feeling a special\n      intensity of existence, that elation common to artists, poets, and lovers&mdash;to\n      men haunted by a great passion, a noble thought, or a new vision of\n      plastic beauty.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The outward world at that time did not exist with any special distinctness\n      for General D&rsquo;Hubert. One evening, however, crossing a ridge from which he\n      could see both houses, General D&rsquo;Hubert became aware of two figures far\n      down the road. The day had been divine. The festal decoration of the\n      inflamed sky lent a gentle glow to the sober tints of the southern land.\n      The grey rocks, the brown fields, the purple, undulating distances\n      harmonized in luminous accord, exhaled already the scents of the evening.\n      The two figures down the road presented themselves like two rigid and\n      wooden silhouettes all black on the ribbon of white dust. General D&rsquo;Hubert\n      made out the long, straight, military capotes buttoned closely right up to\n      the black stocks, the cocked hats, the lean, carven, brown countenances&mdash;old\n      soldiers&mdash;vieilles moustaches! The taller of the two had a black\n      patch over one eye; the other&rsquo;s hard, dry countenance presented some\n      bizarre, disquieting peculiarity, which on nearer approach proved to be\n      the absence of the tip of the nose. Lifting their hands with one movement\n      to salute the slightly lame civilian walking with a thick stick, they\n      inquired for the house where the General Baron D&rsquo;Hubert lived, and what\n      was the best way to get speech with him quietly.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;If you think this quiet enough,&rdquo; said General D&rsquo;Hubert, looking round at\n      the vine-fields, framed in purple lines, and dominated by the nest of grey\n      and drab walls of a village clustering around the top of a conical hill,\n      so that the blunt church tower seemed but the shape of a crowning rock&mdash;&ldquo;if\n      you think this spot quiet enough, you can speak to him at once. And I beg\n      you, comrades, to speak openly, with perfect confidence.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      They stepped back at this, and raised again their hands to their hats with\n      marked ceremoniousness. Then the one with the chipped nose, speaking for\n      both, remarked that the matter was confidential enough, and to be arranged\n      discreetly. Their general quarters were established in that village over\n      there, where the infernal clodhoppers&mdash;damn their false, Royalist\n      hearts!&mdash;looked remarkably cross-eyed at three unassuming military\n      men. For the present he should only ask for the name of General D&rsquo;Hubert&rsquo;s\n      friends.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;What friends?&rdquo; said the astonished General D&rsquo;Hubert, completely off the\n      track. &ldquo;I am staying with my brother-in-law over there.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Well, he will do for one,&rdquo; said the chipped veteran.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re the friends of General Feraud,&rdquo; interjected the other, who had kept\n      silent till then, only glowering with his one eye at the man who had never\n      loved the Emperor. That was something to look at. For even the gold-laced\n      Judases who had sold him to the English, the marshals and princes, had\n      loved him at some time or other. But this man had never loved the Emperor.\n      General Feraud had said so distinctly.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      General D&rsquo;Hubert felt an inward blow in his chest. For an infinitesimal\n      fraction of a second it was as if the spinning of the earth had become\n      perceptible with an awful, slight rustle in the eternal stillness of\n      space. But this noise of blood in his ears passed off at once.\n      Involuntarily he murmured, &ldquo;Feraud! I had forgotten his existence.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s existing at present, very uncomfortably, it is true, in the infamous\n      inn of that nest of savages up there,&rdquo; said the one-eyed cuirassier,\n      drily. &ldquo;We arrived in your parts an hour ago on post horses. He&rsquo;s awaiting\n      our return with impatience. There is hurry, you know. The General has\n      broken the ministerial order to obtain from you the satisfaction he&rsquo;s\n      entitled to by the laws of honour, and naturally he&rsquo;s anxious to have it\n      all over before the gendarmerie gets on his scent.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The other elucidated the idea a little further. &ldquo;Get back on the quiet&mdash;you\n      understand? Phitt! No one the wiser. We have broken out, too. Your friend\n      the king would be glad to cut off our scurvy pittances at the first\n      chance. It&rsquo;s a risk. But honour before everything.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      General D&rsquo;Hubert had recovered his powers of speech. &ldquo;So you come here\n      like this along the road to invite me to a throat-cutting match with that&mdash;that\n      . . .&rdquo; A laughing sort of rage took possession of him. &ldquo;Ha! ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      His fists on his hips, he roared without restraint, while they stood\n      before him lank and straight, as though they had been shot up with a snap\n      through a trap door in the ground. Only four-and-twenty months ago the\n      masters of Europe, they had already the air of antique ghosts, they seemed\n      less substantial in their faded coats than their own narrow shadows\n      falling so black across the white road: the military and grotesque shadows\n      of twenty years of war and conquests. They had an outlandish appearance of\n      two imperturbable bonzes of the religion of the sword. And General\n      D&rsquo;Hubert, also one of the ex-masters of Europe, laughed at these serious\n      phantoms standing in his way.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Said one, indicating the laughing General with a jerk of the head: &ldquo;A\n      merry companion, that.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;There are some of us that haven&rsquo;t smiled from the day The Other went\n      away,&rdquo; remarked his comrade.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      A violent impulse to set upon and beat those unsubstantial wraiths to the\n      ground frightened General D&rsquo;Hubert. He ceased laughing suddenly. His\n      desire now was to get rid of them, to get them away from his sight quickly\n      before he lost control of himself. He wondered at the fury he felt rising\n      in his breast. But he had no time to look into that peculiarity just then.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I understand your wish to be done with me as quickly as possible. Don&rsquo;t\n      let us waste time in empty ceremonies. Do you see that wood there at the\n      foot of that slope? Yes, the wood of pines. Let us meet there to-morrow at\n      sunrise. I will bring with me my sword or my pistols, or both if you\n      like.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The seconds of General Feraud looked at each other.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Pistols, General,&rdquo; said the cuirassier.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;So be it. Au revoir&mdash;to-morrow morning. Till then let me advise you\n      to keep close if you don&rsquo;t want the gendarmerie making inquiries about you\n      before it gets dark. Strangers are rare in this part of the country.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      They saluted in silence. General D&rsquo;Hubert, turning his back on their\n      retreating forms, stood still in the middle of the road for a long time,\n      biting his lower lip and looking on the ground. Then he began to walk\n      straight before him, thus retracing his steps till he found himself before\n      the park gate of his intended&rsquo;s house. Dusk had fallen. Motionless he\n      stared through the bars at the front of the house, gleaming clear beyond\n      the thickets and trees. Footsteps scrunched on the gravel, and presently a\n      tall stooping shape emerged from the lateral alley following the inner\n      side of the park wall.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Le Chevalier de Valmassigue, uncle of the adorable Adele, ex-brigadier in\n      the army of the Princes, bookbinder in Altona, afterwards shoemaker (with\n      a great reputation for elegance in the fit of ladies&rsquo; shoes) in another\n      small German town, wore silk stockings on his lean shanks, low shoes with\n      silver buckles, a brocaded waistcoat. A long-skirted coat, a la francaise,\n      covered loosely his thin, bowed back. A small three-cornered hat rested on\n      a lot of powdered hair, tied in a queue.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Monsieur le Chevalier,&rdquo; called General D&rsquo;Hubert, softly.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;What? You here again, mon ami? Have you forgotten something?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;By heavens! that&rsquo;s just it. I have forgotten something. I am come to tell\n      you of it. No&mdash;outside. Behind this wall. It&rsquo;s too ghastly a thing to\n      be let in at all where she lives.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The Chevalier came out at once with that benevolent resignation some old\n      people display towards the fugue of youth. Older by a quarter of a century\n      than General D&rsquo;Hubert, he looked upon him in the secret of his heart as a\n      rather troublesome youngster in love. He had heard his enigmatical words\n      very well, but attached no undue importance to what a mere man of forty so\n      hard hit was likely to do or say. The turn of mind of the generation of\n      Frenchmen grown up during the years of his exile was almost unintelligible\n      to him. Their sentiments appeared to him unduly violent, lacking fineness\n      and measure, their language needlessly exaggerated. He joined calmly the\n      General on the road, and they made a few steps in silence, the General\n      trying to master his agitation, and get proper control of his voice.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It is perfectly true; I forgot something. I forgot till half an hour ago\n      that I had an urgent affair of honour on my hands. It&rsquo;s incredible, but it\n      is so!&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      All was still for a moment. Then in the profound evening silence of the\n      countryside the clear, aged voice of the Chevalier was heard trembling\n      slightly: &ldquo;Monsieur! That&rsquo;s an indignity.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      It was his first thought. The girl born during his exile, the posthumous\n      daughter of his poor brother murdered by a band of Jacobins, had grown\n      since his return very dear to his old heart, which had been starving on\n      mere memories of affection for so many years. &ldquo;It is an inconceivable\n      thing, I say! A man settles such affairs before he thinks of asking for a\n      young girl&rsquo;s hand. Why! If you had forgotten for ten days longer, you\n      would have been married before your memory returned to you. In my time men\n      did not forget such things&mdash;nor yet what is due to the feelings of an\n      innocent young woman. If I did not respect them myself, I would qualify\n      your conduct in a way which you would not like.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      General D&rsquo;Hubert relieved himself frankly by a groan. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let that\n      consideration prevent you. You run no risk of offending her mortally.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      But the old man paid no attention to this lover&rsquo;s nonsense. It&rsquo;s doubtful\n      whether he even heard. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the nature of . . .\n      ?&rdquo; &ldquo;Call it a youthful folly, Monsieur le Chevalier. An inconceivable,\n      incredible result of . . .&rdquo; He stopped short. &ldquo;He will never believe the\n      story,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;He will only think I am taking him for a fool, and\n      get offended.&rdquo; General D&rsquo;Hubert spoke up again: &ldquo;Yes, originating in\n      youthful folly, it has become . . .&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The Chevalier interrupted: &ldquo;Well, then it must be arranged.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Arranged?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Yes, no matter at what cost to your amour propre. You should have\n      remembered you were engaged. You forgot that, too, I suppose. And then you\n      go and forget your quarrel. It&rsquo;s the most hopeless exhibition of levity I\n      ever heard of.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Good heavens, Monsieur! You don&rsquo;t imagine I have been picking up this\n      quarrel last time I was in Paris, or anything of the sort, do you?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Eh! What matters the precise date of your insane conduct,&rdquo; exclaimed the\n      Chevalier, testily. &ldquo;The principal thing is to arrange it.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Noticing General D&rsquo;Hubert getting restive and trying to place a word, the\n      old emigre raised his hand, and added with dignity, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been a soldier,\n      too. I would never dare suggest a doubtful step to the man whose name my\n      niece is to bear. I tell you that entre galants hommes an affair can\n      always be arranged.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;But saperiotte, Monsieur le Chevalier, it&rsquo;s fifteen or sixteen years ago.\n      I was a lieutenant of hussars then.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The old Chevalier seemed confounded by the vehemently despairing tone of\n      this information. &ldquo;You were a lieutenant of hussars sixteen years ago,&rdquo; he\n      mumbled in a dazed manner.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Why, yes! You did not suppose I was made a general in my cradle like a\n      royal prince.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      In the deepening purple twilight of the fields spread with vine leaves,\n      backed by a low band of sombre crimson in the west, the voice of the old\n      ex-officer in the army of the Princes sounded collected, punctiliously\n      civil.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Do I dream? Is this a pleasantry? Or am I to understand that you have\n      been hatching an affair of honour for sixteen years?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It has clung to me for that length of time. That is my precise meaning.\n      The quarrel itself is not to be explained easily. We met on the ground\n      several times during that time, of course.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;What manners! What horrible perversion of manliness! Nothing can account\n      for such inhumanity but the sanguinary madness of the Revolution which has\n      tainted a whole generation,&rdquo; mused the returned emigre in a low tone.\n      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s your adversary?&rdquo; he asked a little louder.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;My adversary? His name is Feraud.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Shadowy in his tricorne and old-fashioned clothes, like a bowed, thin\n      ghost of the ancien regime, the Chevalier voiced a ghostly memory. &ldquo;I can\n      remember the feud about little Sophie Derval, between Monsieur de Brissac,\n      Captain in the Bodyguards, and d&rsquo;Anjorrant (not the pock-marked one, the\n      other&mdash;the Beau d&rsquo;Anjorrant, as they called him). They met three\n      times in eighteen months in a most gallant manner. It was the fault of\n      that little Sophie, too, who would keep on playing . . .&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;This is nothing of the kind,&rdquo; interrupted General D&rsquo;Hubert. He laughed a\n      little sardonically. &ldquo;Not at all so simple,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Nor yet half so\n      reasonable,&rdquo; he finished, inaudibly, between his teeth, and ground them\n      with rage.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      After this sound nothing troubled the silence for a long time, till the\n      Chevalier asked, without animation: &ldquo;What is he&mdash;this Feraud?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Lieutenant of hussars, too&mdash;I mean, he&rsquo;s a general. A Gascon. Son of\n      a blacksmith, I believe.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;There! I thought so. That Bonaparte had a special predilection for the\n      canaille. I don&rsquo;t mean this for you, D&rsquo;Hubert. You are one of us, though\n      you have served this usurper, who . . .&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s leave him out of this,&rdquo; broke in General D&rsquo;Hubert.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The Chevalier shrugged his peaked shoulders. &ldquo;Feraud of sorts. Offspring\n      of a blacksmith and some village troll. See what comes of mixing yourself\n      up with that sort of people.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;You have made shoes yourself, Chevalier.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Yes. But I am not the son of a shoemaker. Neither are you, Monsieur\n      D&rsquo;Hubert. You and I have something that your Bonaparte&rsquo;s princes, dukes,\n      and marshals have not, because there&rsquo;s no power on earth that could give\n      it to them,&rdquo; retorted the emigre, with the rising animation of a man who\n      has got hold of a hopeful argument. &ldquo;Those people don&rsquo;t exist&mdash;all\n      these Ferauds. Feraud! What is Feraud? A va-nu-pieds disguised into a\n      general by a Corsican adventurer masquerading as an emperor. There is no\n      earthly reason for a D&rsquo;Hubert to s&rsquo;encanailler by a duel with a person of\n      that sort. You can make your excuses to him perfectly well. And if the\n      manant takes into his head to decline them, you may simply refuse to meet\n      him.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;You say I may do that?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I do. With the clearest conscience.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Monsieur le Chevalier! To what do you think you have returned from your\n      emigration?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      This was said in such a startling tone that the old man raised sharply his\n      bowed head, glimmering silvery white under the points of the little\n      tricorne. For a time he made no sound.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;God knows!&rdquo; he said at last, pointing with a slow and grave gesture at a\n      tall roadside cross mounted on a block of stone, and stretching its arms\n      of forged iron all black against the darkening red band in the sky&mdash;&ldquo;God\n      knows! If it were not for this emblem, which I remember seeing on this\n      spot as a child, I would wonder to what we who remained faithful to God\n      and our king have returned. The very voices of the people have changed.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Yes, it is a changed France,&rdquo; said General D&rsquo;Hubert. He seemed to have\n      regained his calm. His tone was slightly ironic. &ldquo;Therefore I cannot take\n      your advice. Besides, how is one to refuse to be bitten by a dog that\n      means to bite? It&rsquo;s impracticable. Take my word for it&mdash;Feraud isn&rsquo;t\n      a man to be stayed by apologies or refusals. But there are other ways. I\n      could, for instance, send a messenger with a word to the brigadier of the\n      gendarmerie in Senlac. He and his two friends are liable to arrest on my\n      simple order. It would make some talk in the army, both the organized and\n      the disbanded&mdash;especially the disbanded. All canaille! All once upon\n      a time the companions in arms of Armand D&rsquo;Hubert. But what need a D&rsquo;Hubert\n      care what people that don&rsquo;t exist may think? Or, better still, I might get\n      my brother-in-law to send for the mayor of the village and give him a\n      hint. No more would be needed to get the three &lsquo;brigands&rsquo; set upon with\n      flails and pitchforks and hunted into some nice, deep, wet ditch&mdash;and\n      nobody the wiser! It has been done only ten miles from here to three poor\n      devils of the disbanded Red Lancers of the Guard going to their homes.\n      What says your conscience, Chevalier? Can a D&rsquo;Hubert do that thing to\n      three men who do not exist?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      A few stars had come out on the blue obscurity, clear as crystal, of the\n      sky. The dry, thin voice of the Chevalier spoke harshly: &ldquo;Why are you\n      telling me all this?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The General seized the withered old hand with a strong grip. &ldquo;Because I\n      owe you my fullest confidence. Who could tell Adele but you? You\n      understand why I dare not trust my brother-in-law nor yet my own sister.\n      Chevalier! I have been so near doing these things that I tremble yet. You\n      don&rsquo;t know how terrible this duel appears to me. And there&rsquo;s no escape\n      from it.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      He murmured after a pause, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fatality,&rdquo; dropped the Chevalier&rsquo;s\n      passive hand, and said in his ordinary conversational voice, &ldquo;I shall have\n      to go without seconds. If it is my lot to remain on the ground, you at\n      least will know all that can be made known of this affair.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The shadowy ghost of the ancien regime seemed to have become more bowed\n      during the conversation. &ldquo;How am I to keep an indifferent face this\n      evening before these two women?&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;General! I find it very\n      difficult to forgive you.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      General D &lsquo;Hubert made no answer.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Is your cause good, at least?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I am innocent.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      This time he seized the Chevalier&rsquo;s ghostly arm above the elbow, and gave\n      it a mighty squeeze. &ldquo;I must kill him!&rdquo; he hissed, and opening his hand\n      strode away down the road.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The delicate attentions of his adoring sister had secured for the General\n      perfect liberty of movement in the house where he was a guest. He had even\n      his own entrance through a small door in one corner of the orangery. Thus\n      he was not exposed that evening to the necessity of dissembling his\n      agitation before the calm ignorance of the other inmates. He was glad of\n      it. It seemed to him that if he had to open his lips he would break out\n      into horrible and aimless imprecations, start breaking furniture, smashing\n      china and glass. From the moment he opened the private door and while\n      ascending the twenty-eight steps of a winding staircase, giving access to\n      the corridor on which his room opened, he went through a horrible and\n      humiliating scene in which an infuriated madman with blood-shot eyes and a\n      foaming mouth played inconceivable havoc with everything inanimate that\n      may be found in a well-appointed dining-room. When he opened the door of\n      his apartment the fit was over, and his bodily fatigue was so great that\n      he had to catch at the backs of the chairs while crossing the room to\n      reach a low and broad divan on which he let himself fall heavily. His\n      moral prostration was still greater. That brutality of feeling which he\n      had known only when charging the enemy, sabre in hand, amazed this man of\n      forty, who did not recognize in it the instinctive fury of his menaced\n      passion. But in his mental and bodily exhaustion this passion got cleared,\n      distilled, refined into a sentiment of melancholy despair at having,\n      perhaps, to die before he had taught this beautiful girl to love him.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      That night, General D&rsquo;Hubert stretched out on his back with his hands over\n      his eyes, or lying on his breast with his face buried in a cushion, made\n      the full pilgrimage of emotions. Nauseating disgust at the absurdity of\n      the situation, doubt of his own fitness to conduct his existence, and\n      mistrust of his best sentiments (for what the devil did he want to go to\n      Fouche for?)&mdash;he knew them all in turn. &ldquo;I am an idiot, neither more\n      nor less,&rdquo; he thought&mdash;&ldquo;A sensitive idiot. Because I overheard two\n      men talking in a cafe. . . . I am an idiot afraid of lies&mdash;whereas in\n      life it is only truth that matters.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Several times he got up and, walking in his socks in order not to be heard\n      by anybody downstairs, drank all the water he could find in the dark. And\n      he tasted the torments of jealousy, too. She would marry somebody else.\n      His very soul writhed. The tenacity of that Feraud, the awful persistence\n      of that imbecile brute, came to him with the tremendous force of a\n      relentless destiny. General D&rsquo;Hubert trembled as he put down the empty\n      water ewer. &ldquo;He will have me,&rdquo; he thought. General D&rsquo;Hubert was tasting\n      every emotion that life has to give. He had in his dry mouth the faint\n      sickly flavour of fear, not the excusable fear before a young girl&rsquo;s\n      candid and amused glance, but the fear of death and the honourable man&rsquo;s\n      fear of cowardice.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      But if true courage consists in going out to meet an odious danger from\n      which our body, soul, and heart recoil together, General D&rsquo;Hubert had the\n      opportunity to practise it for the first time in his life. He had charged\n      exultingly at batteries and at infantry squares, and ridden with messages\n      through a hail of bullets without thinking anything about it. His business\n      now was to sneak out unheard, at break of day, to an obscure and revolting\n      death. General D&rsquo;Hubert never hesitated. He carried two pistols in a\n      leather bag which he slung over his shoulder. Before he had crossed the\n      garden his mouth was dry again. He picked two oranges. It was only after\n      shutting the gate after him that he felt a slight faintness.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He staggered on, disregarding it, and after going a few yards regained the\n      command of his legs. In the colourless and pellucid dawn the wood of pines\n      detached its columns of trunks and its dark green canopy very clearly\n      against the rocks of the grey hillside. He kept his eyes fixed on it\n      steadily, and sucked at an orange as he walked. That temperamental\n      good-humoured coolness in the face of danger which had made him an officer\n      liked by his men and appreciated by his superiors was gradually asserting\n      itself. It was like going into battle. Arriving at the edge of the wood he\n      sat down on a boulder, holding the other orange in his hand, and\n      reproached himself for coming so ridiculously early on the ground. Before\n      very long, however, he heard the swishing of bushes, footsteps on the hard\n      ground, and the sounds of a disjointed, loud conversation. A voice\n      somewhere behind him said boastfully, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s game for my bag.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      He thought to himself, &ldquo;Here they are. What&rsquo;s this about game? Are they\n      talking of me?&rdquo; And becoming aware of the other orange in his hand, he\n      thought further, &ldquo;These are very good oranges. Leonie&rsquo;s own tree. I may\n      just as well eat this orange now instead of flinging it away.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Emerging from a wilderness of rocks and bushes, General Feraud and his\n      seconds discovered General D&rsquo;Hubert engaged in peeling the orange. They\n      stood still, waiting till he looked up. Then the seconds raised their\n      hats, while General Feraud, putting his hands behind his back, walked\n      aside a little way.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I am compelled to ask one of you, messieurs, to act for me. I have\n      brought no friends. Will you?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The one-eyed cuirassier said judicially, &ldquo;That cannot be refused.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The other veteran remarked, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s awkward all the same.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Owing to the state of the people&rsquo;s minds in this part of the country\n      there was no one I could trust safely with the object of your presence\n      here,&rdquo; explained General D&rsquo;Hubert, urbanely.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      They saluted, looked round, and remarked both together:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Poor ground.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfit.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Why bother about ground, measurements, and so on? Let us simplify\n      matters. Load the two pairs of pistols. I will take those of General\n      Feraud, and let him take mine. Or, better still, let us take a mixed pair.\n      One of each pair. Then let us go into the wood and shoot at sight, while\n      you remain outside. We did not come here for ceremonies, but for war&mdash;war\n      to the death. Any ground is good enough for that. If I fall, you must\n      leave me where I lie and clear out. It wouldn&rsquo;t be healthy for you to be\n      found hanging about here after that.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      It appeared after a short parley that General Feraud was willing to accept\n      these conditions. While the seconds were loading the pistols, he could be\n      heard whistling, and was seen to rub his hands with perfect contentment.\n      He flung off his coat briskly, and General D &lsquo;Hubert took off his own and\n      folded it carefully on a stone.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Suppose you take your principal to the other side of the wood and let him\n      enter exactly in ten minutes from now,&rdquo; suggested General D&rsquo;Hubert,\n      calmly, but feeling as if he were giving directions for his own execution.\n      This, however, was his last moment of weakness. &ldquo;Wait. Let us compare\n      watches first.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      He pulled out his own. The officer with the chipped nose went over to\n      borrow the watch of General Feraud. They bent their heads over them for a\n      time.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. At four minutes to six by yours. Seven to by mine.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      It was the cuirassier who remained by the side of General D&rsquo;Hubert,\n      keeping his one eye fixed immovably on the white face of the watch he held\n      in the palm of his hand. He opened his mouth, waiting for the beat of the\n      last second long before he snapped out the word, &ldquo;Avancez.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      General D&rsquo;Hubert moved on, passing from the glaring sunshine of the\n      Provencal morning into the cool and aromatic shade of the pines. The\n      ground was clear between the reddish trunks, whose multitude, leaning at\n      slightly different angles, confused his eye at first. It was like going\n      into battle. The commanding quality of confidence in himself woke up in\n      his breast. He was all to his affair. The problem was how to kill the\n      adversary. Nothing short of that would free him from this imbecile\n      nightmare. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use wounding that brute,&rdquo; thought General D&rsquo;Hubert. He\n      was known as a resourceful officer. His comrades years ago used also to\n      call him The Strategist. And it was a fact that he could think in the\n      presence of the enemy. Whereas Feraud had been always a mere fighter&mdash;but\n      a dead shot, unluckily.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I must draw his fire at the greatest possible range,&rdquo; said General\n      D&rsquo;Hubert to himself.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      At that moment he saw something white moving far off between the trees&mdash;the\n      shirt of his adversary. He stepped out at once between the trunks,\n      exposing himself freely; then, quick as lightning, leaped back. It had\n      been a risky move but it succeeded in its object. Almost simultaneously\n      with the pop of a shot a small piece of bark chipped off by the bullet\n      stung his ear painfully.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      General Feraud, with one shot expended, was getting cautious. Peeping\n      round the tree, General D&rsquo;Hubert could not see him at all. This ignorance\n      of the foe&rsquo;s whereabouts carried with it a sense of insecurity. General\n      D&rsquo;Hubert felt himself abominably exposed on his flank and rear. Again\n      something white fluttered in his sight. Ha! The enemy was still on his\n      front, then. He had feared a turning movement. But apparently General\n      Feraud was not thinking of it. General D&rsquo;Hubert saw him pass without\n      special haste from one tree to another in the straight line of approach.\n      With great firmness of mind General D&rsquo;Hubert stayed his hand. Too far yet.\n      He knew he was no marksman. His must be a waiting game&mdash;to kill.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Wishing to take advantage of the greater thickness of the trunk, he sank\n      down to the ground. Extended at full length, head on to his enemy, he had\n      his person completely protected. Exposing himself would not do now,\n      because the other was too near by this time. A conviction that Feraud\n      would presently do something rash was like balm to General D&rsquo;Hubert&rsquo;s\n      soul. But to keep his chin raised off the ground was irksome, and not much\n      use either. He peeped round, exposing a fraction of his head with dread,\n      but really with little risk. His enemy, as a matter of fact, did not\n      expect to see anything of him so far down as that. General D&rsquo;Hubert caught\n      a fleeting view of General Feraud shifting trees again with deliberate\n      caution. &ldquo;He despises my shooting,&rdquo; he thought, displaying that insight\n      into the mind of his antagonist which is of such great help in winning\n      battles. He was confirmed in his tactics of immobility. &ldquo;If I could only\n      watch my rear as well as my front!&rdquo; he thought anxiously, longing for the\n      impossible.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      It required some force of character to lay his pistols down; but, on a\n      sudden impulse, General D&rsquo;Hubert did this very gently&mdash;one on each\n      side of him. In the army he had been looked upon as a bit of a dandy\n      because he used to shave and put on a clean shirt on the days of battle.\n      As a matter of fact, he had always been very careful of his personal\n      appearance. In a man of nearly forty, in love with a young and charming\n      girl, this praiseworthy self-respect may run to such little weaknesses as,\n      for instance, being provided with an elegant little leather folding-case\n      containing a small ivory comb, and fitted with a piece of looking-glass on\n      the outside. General D&rsquo;Hubert, his hands being free, felt in his breeches&rsquo; \n      pockets for that implement of innocent vanity excusable in the possessor\n      of long, silky moustaches. He drew it out, and then with the utmost\n      coolness and promptitude turned himself over on his back. In this new\n      attitude, his head a little raised, holding the little looking-glass just\n      clear of his tree, he squinted into it with his left eye, while the right\n      kept a direct watch on the rear of his position. Thus was proved\n      Napoleon&rsquo;s saying, that &ldquo;for a French soldier, the word impossible does\n      not exist.&rdquo; He had the right tree nearly filling the field of his little\n      mirror.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;If he moves from behind it,&rdquo; he reflected with satisfaction, &ldquo;I am bound\n      to see his legs. But in any case he can&rsquo;t come upon me unawares.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      And sure enough he saw the boots of General Feraud flash in and out,\n      eclipsing for an instant everything else reflected in the little mirror.\n      He shifted its position accordingly. But having to form his judgment of\n      the change from that indirect view he did not realize that now his feet\n      and a portion of his legs were in plain sight of General Feraud.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      General Feraud had been getting gradually impressed by the amazing\n      cleverness with which his enemy was keeping cover. He had spotted the\n      right tree with bloodthirsty precision. He was absolutely certain of it.\n      And yet he had not been able to glimpse as much as the tip of an ear. As\n      he had been looking for it at the height of about five feet ten inches\n      from the ground it was no great wonder&mdash;but it seemed very wonderful\n      to General Feraud.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The first view of these feet and legs determined a rush of blood to his\n      head. He literally staggered behind his tree, and had to steady himself\n      against it with his hand. The other was lying on the ground, then! On the\n      ground! Perfectly still, too! Exposed! What could it mean? . . . The\n      notion that he had knocked over his adversary at the first shot entered\n      then General Feraud&rsquo;s head. Once there it grew with every second of\n      attentive gazing, overshadowing every other supposition&mdash;irresistible,\n      triumphant, ferocious.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;What an ass I was to think I could have missed him,&rdquo; he muttered to\n      himself. &ldquo;He was exposed en plein&mdash;the fool!&mdash;for quite a couple\n      of seconds.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      General Feraud gazed at the motionless limbs, the last vestiges of\n      surprise fading before an unbounded admiration of his own deadly skill\n      with the pistol.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Turned up his toes! By the god of war, that was a shot!&rdquo; he exulted\n      mentally. &ldquo;Got it through the head, no doubt, just where I aimed,\n      staggered behind that tree, rolled over on his back, and died.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      And he stared! He stared, forgetting to move, almost awed, almost sorry.\n      But for nothing in the world would he have had it undone. Such a shot!&mdash;such\n      a shot! Rolled over on his back and died!\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      For it was this helpless position, lying on the back, that shouted its\n      direct evidence at General Feraud! It never occurred to him that it might\n      have been deliberately assumed by a living man. It was inconceivable. It\n      was beyond the range of sane supposition. There was no possibility to\n      guess the reason for it. And it must be said, too, that General D&rsquo;Hubert&rsquo;s\n      turned-up feet looked thoroughly dead. General Feraud expanded his lungs\n      for a stentorian shout to his seconds, but, from what he felt to be an\n      excessive scrupulousness, refrained for a while.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I will just go and see first whether he breathes yet,&rdquo; he mumbled to\n      himself, leaving carelessly the shelter of his tree. This move was\n      immediately perceived by the resourceful General D&rsquo;Hubert. He concluded it\n      to be another shift, but when he lost the boots out of the field of the\n      mirror he became uneasy. General Feraud had only stepped a little out of\n      the line, but his adversary could not possibly have supposed him walking\n      up with perfect unconcern. General D&rsquo;Hubert, beginning to wonder at what\n      had become of the other, was taken unawares so completely that the first\n      warning of danger consisted in the long, early-morning shadow of his enemy\n      falling aslant on his outstretched legs. He had not even heard a footfall\n      on the soft ground between the trees!\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      It was too much even for his coolness. He jumped up thoughtlessly, leaving\n      the pistols on the ground. The irresistible instinct of an average man\n      (unless totally paralyzed by discomfiture) would have been to stoop for\n      his weapons, exposing himself to the risk of being shot down in that\n      position. Instinct, of course, is irreflective. It is its very definition.\n      But it may be an inquiry worth pursuing whether in reflective mankind the\n      mechanical promptings of instinct are not affected by the customary mode\n      of thought. In his young days, Armand D&rsquo;Hubert, the reflective, promising\n      officer, had emitted the opinion that in warfare one should &ldquo;never cast\n      back on the lines of a mistake.&rdquo; This idea, defended and developed in many\n      discussions, had settled into one of the stock notions of his brain, had\n      become a part of his mental individuality. Whether it had gone so\n      inconceivably deep as to affect the dictates of his instinct, or simply\n      because, as he himself declared afterwards, he was &ldquo;too scared to remember\n      the confounded pistols,&rdquo; the fact is that General D&rsquo;Hubert never attempted\n      to stoop for them. Instead of going back on his mistake, he seized the\n      rough trunk with both hands, and swung himself behind it with such\n      impetuosity that, going right round in the very flash and report of the\n      pistol-shot, he reappeared on the other side of the tree face to face with\n      General Feraud. This last, completely unstrung by such a show of agility\n      on the part of a dead man, was trembling yet. A very faint mist of smoke\n      hung before his face which had an extraordinary aspect, as if the lower\n      jaw had come unhinged.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Not missed!&rdquo; he croaked, hoarsely, from the depths of a dry throat.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      This sinister sound loosened the spell that had fallen on General\n      D&rsquo;Hubert&rsquo;s senses. &ldquo;Yes, missed&mdash;a bout portant,&rdquo; he heard himself\n      saying, almost before he had recovered the full command of his faculties.\n      The revulsion of feeling was accompanied by a gust of homicidal fury,\n      resuming in its violence the accumulated resentment of a lifetime. For\n      years General D &lsquo;Hubert had been exasperated and humiliated by an\n      atrocious absurdity imposed upon him by this man&rsquo;s savage caprice.\n      Besides, General D&rsquo;Hubert had been in this last instance too unwilling to\n      confront death for the reaction of his anguish not to take the shape of a\n      desire to kill. &ldquo;And I have my two shots to fire yet,&rdquo; he added,\n      pitilessly.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      General Feraud snapped-to his teeth, and his face assumed an irate,\n      undaunted expression. &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; he said, grimly.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      These would have been his last words if General D&rsquo;Hubert had been holding\n      the pistols in his hands. But the pistols were lying on the ground at the\n      foot of a pine. General D&rsquo;Hubert had the second of leisure necessary to\n      remember that he had dreaded death not as a man, but as a lover; not as a\n      danger, but as a rival; not as a foe to life, but as an obstacle to\n      marriage. And behold! there was the rival defeated!&mdash;utterly\n      defeated, crushed, done for!\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He picked up the weapons mechanically, and, instead of firing them into\n      General Feraud&rsquo;s breast, he gave expression to the thoughts uppermost in\n      his mind, &ldquo;You will fight no more duels now.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      His tone of leisurely, ineffable satisfaction was too much for General\n      Feraud&rsquo;s stoicism. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t dawdle, then, damn you for a cold-blooded\n      staff-coxcomb!&rdquo; he roared out, suddenly, out of an impassive face held\n      erect on a rigidly still body.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      General D&rsquo;Hubert uncocked the pistols carefully. This proceeding was\n      observed with mixed feelings by the other general. &ldquo;You missed me twice,&rdquo;\n       the victor said, coolly, shifting both pistols to one hand; &ldquo;the last time\n      within a foot or so. By every rule of single combat your life belongs to\n      me. That does not mean that I want to take it now.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I have no use for your forbearance,&rdquo; muttered General Feraud, gloomily.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Allow me to point out that this is no concern of mine,&rdquo; said General\n      D&rsquo;Hubert, whose every word was dictated by a consummate delicacy of\n      feeling. In anger he could have killed that man, but in cold blood he\n      recoiled from humiliating by a show of generosity this unreasonable being&mdash;a\n      fellow-soldier of the Grande Armee, a companion in the wonders and terrors\n      of the great military epic. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t set up the pretension of dictating\n      to me what I am to do with what&rsquo;s my own.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      General Feraud looked startled, and the other continued, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve forced me\n      on a point of honour to keep my life at your disposal, as it were, for\n      fifteen years. Very well. Now that the matter is decided to my advantage,\n      I am going to do what I like with your life on the same principle. You\n      shall keep it at my disposal as long as I choose. Neither more nor less.\n      You are on your honour till I say the word.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I am! But, sacrebleu! This is an absurd position for a General of the\n      Empire to be placed in!&rdquo; cried General Feraud, in accents of profound and\n      dismayed conviction. &ldquo;It amounts to sitting all the rest of my life with a\n      loaded pistol in a drawer waiting for your word. It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s idiotic;\n      I shall be an object of&mdash;of&mdash;derision.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Absurd?&mdash;idiotic? Do you think so?&rdquo; queried General D&rsquo;Hubert with\n      sly gravity. &ldquo;Perhaps. But I don&rsquo;t see how that can be helped. However, I\n      am not likely to talk at large of this adventure. Nobody need ever know\n      anything about it. Just as no one to this day, I believe, knows the origin\n      of our quarrel. . . . Not a word more,&rdquo; he added, hastily. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t really\n      discuss this question with a man who, as far as I am concerned, does not\n      exist.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      When the two duellists came out into the open, General Feraud walking a\n      little behind, and rather with the air of walking in a trance, the two\n      seconds hurried towards them, each from his station at the edge of the\n      wood. General D&rsquo;Hubert addressed them, speaking loud and distinctly,\n      &ldquo;Messieurs, I make it a point of declaring to you solemnly, in the\n      presence of General Feraud, that our difference is at last settled for\n      good. You may inform all the world of that fact.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;A reconciliation, after all!&rdquo; they exclaimed together.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Reconciliation? Not that exactly. It is something much more binding. Is\n      it not so, General?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      General Feraud only lowered his head in sign of assent. The two veterans\n      looked at each other. Later in the day, when they found themselves alone\n      out of their moody friend&rsquo;s earshot, the cuirassier remarked suddenly,\n      &ldquo;Generally speaking, I can see with my one eye as far as most people; but\n      this beats me. He won&rsquo;t say anything.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;In this affair of honour I understand there has been from first to last\n      always something that no one in the army could quite make out,&rdquo; declared\n      the chasseur with the imperfect nose. &ldquo;In mystery it began, in mystery it\n      went on, in mystery it is to end, apparently.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      General D&rsquo;Hubert walked home with long, hasty strides, by no means\n      uplifted by a sense of triumph. He had conquered, yet it did not seem to\n      him that he had gained very much by his conquest. The night before he had\n      grudged the risk of his life which appeared to him magnificent, worthy of\n      preservation as an opportunity to win a girl&rsquo;s love. He had known moments\n      when, by a marvellous illusion, this love seemed to be already his, and\n      his threatened life a still more magnificent opportunity of devotion. Now\n      that his life was safe it had suddenly lost its special magnificence. It\n      had acquired instead a specially alarming aspect as a snare for the\n      exposure of unworthiness. As to the marvellous illusion of conquered love\n      that had visited him for a moment in the agitated watches of the night,\n      which might have been his last on earth, he comprehended now its true\n      nature. It had been merely a paroxysm of delirious conceit. Thus to this\n      man, sobered by the victorious issue of a duel, life appeared robbed of\n      its charm, simply because it was no longer menaced.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Approaching the house from the back, through the orchard and the kitchen\n      garden, he could not notice the agitation which reigned in front. He never\n      met a single soul. Only while walking softly along the corridor, he became\n      aware that the house was awake and more noisy than usual. Names of\n      servants were being called out down below in a confused noise of coming\n      and going. With some concern he noticed that the door of his own room\n      stood ajar, though the shutters had not been opened yet. He had hoped that\n      his early excursion would have passed unperceived. He expected to find\n      some servant just gone in; but the sunshine filtering through the usual\n      cracks enabled him to see lying on the low divan something bulky, which\n      had the appearance of two women clasped in each other&rsquo;s arms. Tearful and\n      desolate murmurs issued mysteriously from that appearance. General\n      D&rsquo;Hubert pulled open the nearest pair of shutters violently. One of the\n      women then jumped up. It was his sister. She stood for a moment with her\n      hair hanging down and her arms raised straight up above her head, and then\n      flung herself with a stifled cry into his arms. He returned her embrace,\n      trying at the same time to disengage himself from it. The other woman had\n      not risen. She seemed, on the contrary, to cling closer to the divan,\n      hiding her face in the cushions. Her hair was also loose; it was admirably\n      fair. General D&rsquo;Hubert recognized it with staggering emotion. Mademoiselle\n      de Valmassigue! Adele! In distress!\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He became greatly alarmed, and got rid of his sister&rsquo;s hug definitely.\n      Madame Leonie then extended her shapely bare arm out of her peignoir,\n      pointing dramatically at the divan. &ldquo;This poor, terrified child has rushed\n      here from home, on foot, two miles&mdash;running all the way.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;What on earth has happened?&rdquo; asked General D&rsquo;Hubert in a low, agitated\n      voice.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      But Madame Leonie was speaking loudly. &ldquo;She rang the great bell at the\n      gate and roused all the household&mdash;we were all asleep yet. You may\n      imagine what a terrible shock. . . . Adele, my dear child, sit up.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      General D&rsquo;Hubert&rsquo;s expression was not that of a man who &ldquo;imagines&rdquo; with\n      facility. He did, however, fish out of the chaos of surmises the notion\n      that his prospective mother-in-law had died suddenly, but only to dismiss\n      it at once. He could not conceive the nature of the event or the\n      catastrophe which would induce Mademoiselle de Valmassigue, living in a\n      house full of servants, to bring the news over the fields herself, two\n      miles, running all the way.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;But why are you in this room?&rdquo; he whispered, full of awe.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Of course, I ran up to see, and this child . . . I did not notice it . .\n      . she followed me. It&rsquo;s that absurd Chevalier,&rdquo; went on Madame Leonie,\n      looking towards the divan. . . . &ldquo;Her hair is all come down. You may\n      imagine she did not stop to call her maid to dress it before she started.\n      . . Adele, my dear, sit up. . . . He blurted it all out to her at\n      half-past five in the morning. She woke up early and opened her shutters\n      to breathe the fresh air, and saw him sitting collapsed on a garden bench\n      at the end of the great alley. At that hour&mdash;you may imagine! And the\n      evening before he had declared himself indisposed. She hurried on some\n      clothes and flew down to him. One would be anxious for less. He loves her,\n      but not very intelligently. He had been up all night, fully dressed, the\n      poor old man, perfectly exhausted. He wasn&rsquo;t in a state to invent a\n      plausible story. . . . What a confidant you chose there! My husband was\n      furious. He said, &lsquo;We can&rsquo;t interfere now.&rsquo; So we sat down to wait. It was\n      awful. And this poor child running with her hair loose over here publicly!\n      She has been seen by some people in the fields. She has roused the whole\n      household, too. It&rsquo;s awkward for her. Luckily you are to be married next\n      week. . . . Adele, sit up. He has come home on his own legs. . . . We\n      expected to see you coming on a stretcher, perhaps&mdash;what do I know?\n      Go and see if the carriage is ready. I must take this child home at once.\n      It isn&rsquo;t proper for her to stay here a minute longer.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      General D&rsquo;Hubert did not move. It was as though he had heard nothing.\n      Madame Leonie changed her mind. &ldquo;I will go and see myself,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I\n      want also my cloak.&mdash;Adele&mdash;&rdquo; she began, but did not add &ldquo;sit\n      up.&rdquo; She went out saying, in a very loud and cheerful tone: &ldquo;I leave the\n      door open.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      General D&rsquo;Hubert made a movement towards the divan, but then Adele sat up,\n      and that checked him dead. He thought, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t washed this morning. I\n      must look like an old tramp. There&rsquo;s earth on the back of my coat and\n      pine-needles in my hair.&rdquo; It occurred to him that the situation required a\n      good deal of circumspection on his part.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I am greatly concerned, mademoiselle,&rdquo; he began, vaguely, and abandoned\n      that line. She was sitting up on the divan with her cheeks unusually pink\n      and her hair, brilliantly fair, falling all over her shoulders&mdash;which\n      was a very novel sight to the general. He walked away up the room, and\n      looking out of the window for safety said, &ldquo;I fear you must think I\n      behaved like a madman,&rdquo; in accents of sincere despair. Then he spun round,\n      and noticed that she had followed him with her eyes. They were not cast\n      down on meeting his glance. And the expression of her face was novel to\n      him also. It was, one might have said, reversed. Those eyes looked at him\n      with grave thoughtfulness, while the exquisite lines of her mouth seemed\n      to suggest a restrained smile. This change made her transcendental beauty\n      much less mysterious, much more accessible to a man&rsquo;s comprehension. An\n      amazing ease of mind came to the general&mdash;and even some ease of\n      manner. He walked down the room with as much pleasurable excitement as he\n      would have found in walking up to a battery vomiting death, fire, and\n      smoke; then stood looking down with smiling eyes at the girl whose\n      marriage with him (next week) had been so carefully arranged by the wise,\n      the good, the admirable Leonie.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Ah! mademoiselle,&rdquo; he said, in a tone of courtly regret, &ldquo;if only I could\n      be certain that you did not come here this morning, two miles, running all\n      the way, merely from affection for your mother!&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      He waited for an answer imperturbable but inwardly elated. It came in a\n      demure murmur, eyelashes lowered with fascinating effect. &ldquo;You must not be\n      mechant as well as mad.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      And then General D&rsquo;Hubert made an aggressive movement towards the divan\n      which nothing could check. That piece of furniture was not exactly in the\n      line of the open door. But Madame Leonie, coming back wrapped up in a\n      light cloak and carrying a lace shawl on her arm for Adele to hide her\n      incriminating hair under, had a swift impression of her brother getting up\n      from his knees.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Come along, my dear child,&rdquo; she cried from the doorway.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The general, now himself again in the fullest sense, showed the readiness\n      of a resourceful cavalry officer and the peremptoriness of a leader of\n      men. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t expect her to walk to the carriage,&rdquo; he said, indignantly.\n      &ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t fit. I shall carry her downstairs.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      This he did slowly, followed by his awed and respectful sister; but he\n      rushed back like a whirlwind to wash off all the signs of the night of\n      anguish and the morning of war, and to put on the festive garments of a\n      conqueror before hurrying over to the other house. Had it not been for\n      that, General D &lsquo;Hubert felt capable of mounting a horse and pursuing his\n      late adversary in order simply to embrace him from excess of happiness. &ldquo;I\n      owe it all to this stupid brute,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;He has made plain in a\n      morning what might have taken me years to find out&mdash;for I am a timid\n      fool. No self-confidence whatever. Perfect coward. And the Chevalier!\n      Delightful old man!&rdquo; General D&rsquo;Hubert longed to embrace him also.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The Chevalier was in bed. For several days he was very unwell. The men of\n      the Empire and the post-revolution young ladies were too much for him. He\n      got up the day before the wedding, and, being curious by nature, took his\n      niece aside for a quiet talk. He advised her to find out from her husband\n      the true story of the affair of honour, whose claim, so imperative and so\n      persistent, had led her to within an ace of tragedy. &ldquo;It is right that his\n      wife should be told. And next month or so will be your time to learn from\n      him anything you want to know, my dear child.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Later on, when the married couple came on a visit to the mother of the\n      bride, Madame la Generale D&rsquo;Hubert communicated to her beloved old uncle\n      the true story she had obtained without any difficulty from her husband.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The Chevalier listened with deep attention to the end, took a pinch of\n      snuff, flicked the grains of tobacco from the frilled front of his shirt,\n      and asked, calmly, &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s all it was?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Yes, uncle,&rdquo; replied Madame la Generale, opening her pretty eyes very\n      wide. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it funny? C&rsquo;est insense&mdash;to think what men are capable\n      of!&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; commented the old emigre. &ldquo;It depends what sort of men. That\n      Bonaparte&rsquo;s soldiers were savages. It is insense. As a wife, my dear, you\n      must believe implicitly what your husband says.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      But to Leonie&rsquo;s husband the Chevalier confided his true opinion. &ldquo;If\n      that&rsquo;s the tale the fellow made up for his wife, and during the honeymoon,\n      too, you may depend on it that no one will ever know now the secret of\n      this affair.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Considerably later still, General D&rsquo;Hubert judged the time come, and the\n      opportunity propitious to write a letter to General Feraud. This letter\n      began by disclaiming all animosity. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never,&rdquo; wrote the General Baron\n      D&rsquo;Hubert, &ldquo;wished for your death during all the time of our deplorable\n      quarrel. Allow me,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;to give you back in all form your\n      forfeited life. It is proper that we two, who have been partners in so\n      much military glory, should be friendly to each other publicly.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The same letter contained also an item of domestic information. It was in\n      reference to this last that General Feraud answered from a little village\n      on the banks of the Garonne, in the following words:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;If one of your boy&rsquo;s names had been Napoleon&mdash;or Joseph&mdash;or\n      even Joachim, I could congratulate you on the event with a better heart.\n      As you have thought proper to give him the names of Charles Henri Armand,\n      I am confirmed in my conviction that you never loved the Emperor. The\n      thought of that sublime hero chained to a rock in the middle of a savage\n      ocean makes life of so little value that I would receive with positive joy\n      your instructions to blow my brains out. From suicide I consider myself in\n      honour debarred. But I keep a loaded pistol in my drawer.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Madame la Generale D&rsquo;Hubert lifted up her hands in despair after perusing\n      that answer.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;You see? He won&rsquo;t be reconciled,&rdquo; said her husband. &ldquo;He must never, by\n      any chance, be allowed to guess where the money comes from. It wouldn&rsquo;t\n      do. He couldn&rsquo;t bear it.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;You are a brave homme, Armand,&rdquo; said Madame la Generale, appreciatively.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;My dear, I had the right to blow his brains out; but as I didn&rsquo;t, we\n      can&rsquo;t let him starve. He has lost his pension and he is utterly incapable\n      of doing anything in the world for himself. We must take care of him,\n      secretly, to the end of his days. Don&rsquo;t I owe him the most ecstatic moment\n      of my life? . . . Ha! ha! ha! Over the fields, two miles, running all the\n      way! I couldn&rsquo;t believe my ears! . . . But for his stupid ferocity, it\n      would have taken me years to find you out. It&rsquo;s extraordinary how in one\n      way or another this man has managed to fasten himself on my deeper\n      feelings.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      <a name=\"link2H_4_0008\" id=\"link2H_4_0008\">\n      <!--  H2 anchor --> </a>\n    </p>\n    <div style=\"height: 4em;\">\n      <br /><br /><br /><br />\n    </div>\n    <h2>\n      IL CONDE\n    </h2>\n    <h3>\n      A PATHETIC TALE\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;<i>Vedi Napoli e poi mori</i>.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The first time we got into conversation was in the National Museum in\n      Naples, in the rooms on the ground floor containing the famous collection\n      of bronzes from Herculaneum and Pompeii: that marvellous legacy of antique\n      art whose delicate perfection has been preserved for us by the\n      catastrophic fury of a volcano.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He addressed me first, over the celebrated Resting Hermes which we had\n      been looking at side by side. He said the right things about that wholly\n      admirable piece. Nothing profound. His taste was natural rather than\n      cultivated. He had obviously seen many fine things in his life and\n      appreciated them: but he had no jargon of a dilettante or the connoisseur.\n      A hateful tribe. He spoke like a fairly intelligent man of the world, a\n      perfectly unaffected gentleman.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      We had known each other by sight for some few days past. Staying in the\n      same hotel&mdash;good, but not extravagantly up to date&mdash;I had\n      noticed him in the vestibule going in and out. I judged he was an old and\n      valued client. The bow of the hotel-keeper was cordial in its deference,\n      and he acknowledged it with familiar courtesy. For the servants he was Il\n      Conde. There was some squabble over a man&rsquo;s parasol&mdash;yellow silk with\n      white lining sort of thing&mdash;the waiters had discovered abandoned\n      outside the dining-room door. Our gold-laced door-keeper recognized it and\n      I heard him directing one of the lift boys to run after Il Conde with it.\n      Perhaps he was the only Count staying in the hotel, or perhaps he had the\n      distinction of being the Count par excellence, conferred upon him because\n      of his tried fidelity to the house.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Having conversed at the Museo&mdash;(and by the by he had expressed his\n      dislike of the busts and statues of Roman emperors in the gallery of\n      marbles: their faces were too vigorous, too pronounced for him)&mdash;having\n      conversed already in the morning I did not think I was intruding when in\n      the evening, finding the dining-room very full, I proposed to share his\n      little table. Judging by the quiet urbanity of his consent he did not\n      think so either. His smile was very attractive.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He dined in an evening waistcoat and a &ldquo;smoking&rdquo; (he called it so) with a\n      black tie. All this of very good cut, not new&mdash;just as these things\n      should be. He was, morning or evening, very correct in his dress. I have\n      no doubt that his whole existence had been correct, well ordered and\n      conventional, undisturbed by startling events. His white hair brushed\n      upwards off a lofty forehead gave him the air of an idealist, of an\n      imaginative man. His white moustache, heavy but carefully trimmed and\n      arranged, was not unpleasantly tinted a golden yellow in the middle. The\n      faint scent of some very good perfume, and of good cigars (that last an\n      odour quite remarkable to come upon in Italy) reached me across the table.\n      It was in his eyes that his age showed most. They were a little weary with\n      creased eyelids. He must have been sixty or a couple of years more. And he\n      was communicative. I would not go so far as to call it garrulous&mdash;but\n      distinctly communicative.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He had tried various climates, of Abbazia, of the Riviera, of other\n      places, too, he told me, but the only one which suited him was the climate\n      of the Gulf of Naples. The ancient Romans, who, he pointed out to me, were\n      men expert in the art of living, knew very well what they were doing when\n      they built their villas on these shores, in Baiae, in Vico, in Capri. They\n      came down to this seaside in search of health, bringing with them their\n      trains of mimes and flute-players to amuse their leisure. He thought it\n      extremely probable that the Romans of the higher classes were specially\n      predisposed to painful rheumatic affections.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      This was the only personal opinion I heard him express. It was based on no\n      special erudition. He knew no more of the Romans than an average informed\n      man of the world is expected to know. He argued from personal experience.\n      He had suffered himself from a painful and dangerous rheumatic affection\n      till he found relief in this particular spot of Southern Europe.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      This was three years ago, and ever since he had taken up his quarters on\n      the shores of the gulf, either in one of the hotels in Sorrento or hiring\n      a small villa in Capri. He had a piano, a few books: picked up transient\n      acquaintances of a day, week, or month in the stream of travellers from\n      all Europe. One can imagine him going out for his walks in the streets and\n      lanes, becoming known to beggars, shopkeepers, children, country people;\n      talking amiably over the walls to the contadini&mdash;and coming back to\n      his rooms or his villa to sit before the piano, with his white hair\n      brushed up and his thick orderly moustache, &ldquo;to make a little music for\n      myself.&rdquo; And, of course, for a change there was Naples near by&mdash;life,\n      movement, animation, opera. A little amusement, as he said, is necessary\n      for health. Mimes and flute-players, in fact. Only unlike the magnates of\n      ancient Rome, he had no affairs of the city to call him away from these\n      moderate delights. He had no affairs at all. Probably he had never had any\n      grave affairs to attend to in his life. It was a kindly existence, with\n      its joys and sorrows regulated by the course of Nature&mdash;marriages,\n      births, deaths&mdash;ruled by the prescribed usages of good society and\n      protected by the State.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He was a widower; but in the months of July and August he ventured to\n      cross the Alps for six weeks on a visit to his married daughter. He told\n      me her name. It was that of a very aristocratic family. She had a castle&mdash;in\n      Bohemia, I think. This is as near as I ever came to ascertaining his\n      nationality. His own name, strangely enough, he never mentioned. Perhaps\n      he thought I had seen it on the published list. Truth to say, I never\n      looked. At any rate, he was a good European&mdash;he spoke four languages\n      to my certain knowledge&mdash;and a man of fortune. Not of great fortune\n      evidently and appropriately. I imagine that to be extremely rich would\n      have appeared to him improper, outre&mdash;too blatant altogether. And\n      obviously, too, the fortune was not of his making. The making of a fortune\n      cannot be achieved without some roughness. It is a matter of temperament.\n      His nature was too kindly for strife. In the course of conversation he\n      mentioned his estate quite by the way, in reference to that painful and\n      alarming rheumatic affection. One year, staying incautiously beyond the\n      Alps as late as the middle of September, he had been laid up for three\n      months in that lonely country house with no one but his valet and the\n      caretaking couple to attend to him. Because, as he expressed it, he &ldquo;kept\n      no establishment there.&rdquo; He had only gone for a couple of days to confer\n      with his land agent. He promised himself never to be so imprudent in the\n      future. The first weeks of September would find him on the shores of his\n      beloved gulf.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Sometimes in travelling one comes upon such lonely men, whose only\n      business is to wait for the unavoidable. Deaths and marriages have made a\n      solitude round them, and one really cannot blame their endeavours to make\n      the waiting as easy as possible. As he remarked to me, &ldquo;At my time of life\n      freedom from physical pain is a very important matter.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      It must not be imagined that he was a wearisome hypochondriac. He was\n      really much too well-bred to be a nuisance. He had an eye for the small\n      weaknesses of humanity. But it was a good-natured eye. He made a restful,\n      easy, pleasant companion for the hours between dinner and bedtime. We\n      spent three evenings together, and then I had to leave Naples in a hurry\n      to look after a friend who had fallen seriously ill in Taormina. Having\n      nothing to do, Il Conde came to see me off at the station. I was somewhat\n      upset, and his idleness was always ready to take a kindly form. He was by\n      no means an indolent man.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He went along the train peering into the carriages for a good seat for me,\n      and then remained talking cheerily from below. He declared he would miss\n      me that evening very much and announced his intention of going after\n      dinner to listen to the band in the public garden, the Villa Nazionale. He\n      would amuse himself by hearing excellent music and looking at the best\n      society. There would be a lot of people, as usual.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      I seem to see him yet&mdash;his raised face with a friendly smile under\n      the thick moustaches, and his kind, fatigued eyes. As the train began to\n      move, he addressed me in two languages: first in French, saying, &ldquo;Bon\n      voyage&rdquo;; then, in his very good, somewhat emphatic English, encouragingly,\n      because he could see my concern: &ldquo;All will&mdash;be&mdash;well&mdash;yet!&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      My friend&rsquo;s illness having taken a decidedly favourable turn, I returned\n      to Naples on the tenth day. I cannot say I had given much thought to Il\n      Conde during my absence, but entering the dining-room I looked for him in\n      his habitual place. I had an idea he might have gone back to Sorrento to\n      his piano and his books and his fishing. He was great friends with all the\n      boatmen, and fished a good deal with lines from a boat. But I made out his\n      white head in the crowd of heads, and even from a distance noticed\n      something unusual in his attitude. Instead of sitting erect, gazing all\n      round with alert urbanity, he drooped over his plate. I stood opposite him\n      for some time before he looked up, a little wildly, if such a strong word\n      can be used in connection with his correct appearance.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Ah, my dear sir! Is it you?&rdquo; he greeted me. &ldquo;I hope all is well.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      He was very nice about my friend. Indeed, he was always nice, with the\n      niceness of people whose hearts are genuinely humane. But this time it\n      cost him an effort. His attempts at general conversation broke down into\n      dullness. It occurred to me he might have been indisposed. But before I\n      could frame the inquiry he muttered:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;You find me here very sad.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I am sorry for that,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t had bad news, I hope?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      It was very kind of me to take an interest. No. It was not that. No bad\n      news, thank God. And he became very still as if holding his breath. Then,\n      leaning forward a little, and in an odd tone of awed embarrassment, he\n      took me into his confidence.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The truth is that I have had a very&mdash;a very&mdash;how shall I say?&mdash;abominable\n      adventure happen to me.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The energy of the epithet was sufficiently startling in that man of\n      moderate feelings and toned-down vocabulary. The word unpleasant I should\n      have thought would have fitted amply the worst experience likely to befall\n      a man of his stamp. And an adventure, too. Incredible! But it is in human\n      nature to believe the worst; and I confess I eyed him stealthily,\n      wondering what he had been up to. In a moment, however, my unworthy\n      suspicions vanished. There was a fundamental refinement of nature about\n      the man which made me dismiss all idea of some more or less disreputable\n      scrape.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It is very serious. Very serious.&rdquo; He went on, nervously. &ldquo;I will tell\n      you after dinner, if you will allow me.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      I expressed my perfect acquiescence by a little bow, nothing more. I\n      wished him to understand that I was not likely to hold him to that offer,\n      if he thought better of it later on. We talked of indifferent things, but\n      with a sense of difficulty quite unlike our former easy, gossipy\n      intercourse. The hand raising a piece of bread to his lips, I noticed,\n      trembled slightly. This symptom, in regard to my reading of the man, was\n      no less than startling.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In the smoking-room he did not hang back at all. Directly we had taken our\n      usual seats he leaned sideways over the arm of his chair and looked\n      straight into my eyes earnestly.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;You remember,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;that day you went away? I told you then I would\n      go to the Villa Nazionale to hear some music in the evening.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      I remembered. His handsome old face, so fresh for his age, unmarked by any\n      trying experience, appeared haggard for an instant. It was like the\n      passing of a shadow. Returning his steadfast gaze, I took a sip of my\n      black coffee. He was systematically minute in his narrative, simply in\n      order, I think, not to let his excitement get the better of him.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      After leaving the railway station, he had an ice, and read the paper in a\n      cafe. Then he went back to the hotel, dressed for dinner, and dined with a\n      good appetite. After dinner he lingered in the hall (there were chairs and\n      tables there) smoking his cigar; talked to the little girl of the Primo\n      Tenore of the San Carlo theatre, and exchanged a few words with that\n      &ldquo;amiable lady,&rdquo; the wife of the Primo Tenore. There was no performance\n      that evening, and these people were going to the Villa also. They went out\n      of the hotel. Very well.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      At the moment of following their example&mdash;it was half-past nine\n      already&mdash;he remembered he had a rather large sum of money in his\n      pocket-book. He entered, therefore, the office and deposited the greater\n      part of it with the book-keeper of the hotel. This done, he took a\n      carozella and drove to the seashore. He got out of the cab and entered the\n      Villa on foot from the Largo di Vittoria end.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He stared at me very hard. And I understood then how really impressionable\n      he was. Every small fact and event of that evening stood out in his memory\n      as if endowed with mystic significance. If he did not mention to me the\n      colour of the pony which drew the carozella, and the aspect of the man who\n      drove, it was a mere oversight arising from his agitation, which he\n      repressed manfully.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He had then entered the Villa Nazionale from the Largo di Vittoria end.\n      The Villa Nazionale is a public pleasure-ground laid out in grass plots,\n      bushes, and flower-beds between the houses of the Riviera di Chiaja and\n      the waters of the bay. Alleys of trees, more or less parallel, stretch its\n      whole length&mdash;which is considerable. On the Riviera di Chiaja side\n      the electric tramcars run close to the railings. Between the garden and\n      the sea is the fashionable drive, a broad road bordered by a low wall,\n      beyond which the Mediterranean splashes with gentle murmurs when the\n      weather is fine.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      As life goes on late at night in Naples, the broad drive was all astir\n      with a brilliant swarm of carriage lamps moving in pairs, some creeping\n      slowly, others running rapidly under the thin, motionless line of electric\n      lamps defining the shore. And a brilliant swarm of stars hung above the\n      land humming with voices, piled up with houses, glittering with lights&mdash;and\n      over the silent flat shadows of the sea.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The gardens themselves are not very well lit. Our friend went forward in\n      the warm gloom, his eyes fixed upon a distant luminous region extending\n      nearly across the whole width of the Villa, as if the air had glowed there\n      with its own cold, bluish, and dazzling light. This magic spot, behind the\n      black trunks of trees and masses of inky foliage, breathed out sweet\n      sounds mingled with bursts of brassy roar, sudden clashes of metal, and\n      grave, vibrating thuds.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      As he walked on, all these noises combined together into a piece of\n      elaborate music whose harmonious phrases came persuasively through a great\n      disorderly murmur of voices and shuffling of feet on the gravel of that\n      open space. An enormous crowd immersed in the electric light, as if in a\n      bath of some radiant and tenuous fluid shed upon their heads by luminous\n      globes, drifted in its hundreds round the band. Hundreds more sat on\n      chairs in more or less concentric circles, receiving unflinchingly the\n      great waves of sonority that ebbed out into the darkness. The Count\n      penetrated the throng, drifted with it in tranquil enjoyment, listening\n      and looking at the faces. All people of good society: mothers with their\n      daughters, parents and children, young men and young women all talking,\n      smiling, nodding to each other. Very many pretty faces, and very many\n      pretty toilettes. There was, of course, a quantity of diverse types: showy\n      old fellows with white moustaches, fat men, thin men, officers in uniform;\n      but what predominated, he told me, was the South Italian type of young\n      man, with a colourless, clear complexion, red lips, jet-black little\n      moustache and liquid black eyes so wonderfully effective in leering or\n      scowling.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Withdrawing from the throng, the Count shared a little table in front of\n      the cafe with a young man of just such a type. Our friend had some\n      lemonade. The young man was sitting moodily before an empty glass. He\n      looked up once, and then looked down again. He also tilted his hat\n      forward. Like this&mdash;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The Count made the gesture of a man pulling his hat down over his brow,\n      and went on:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I think to myself: he is sad; something is wrong with him; young men have\n      their troubles. I take no notice of him, of course. I pay for my lemonade,\n      and go away.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Strolling about in the neighbourhood of the band, the Count thinks he saw\n      twice that young man wandering alone in the crowd. Once their eyes met. It\n      must have been the same young man, but there were so many there of that\n      type that he could not be certain. Moreover, he was not very much\n      concerned except in so far that he had been struck by the marked, peevish\n      discontent of that face.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Presently, tired of the feeling of confinement one experiences in a crowd,\n      the Count edged away from the band. An alley, very sombre by contrast,\n      presented itself invitingly with its promise of solitude and coolness. He\n      entered it, walking slowly on till the sound of the orchestra became\n      distinctly deadened. Then he walked back and turned about once more. He\n      did this several times before he noticed that there was somebody occupying\n      one of the benches.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The spot being midway between two lamp-posts the light was faint.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The man lolled back in the corner of the seat, his legs stretched out, his\n      arms folded and his head drooping on his breast. He never stirred, as\n      though he had fallen asleep there, but when the Count passed by next time\n      he had changed his attitude. He sat leaning forward. His elbows were\n      propped on his knees, and his hands were rolling a cigarette. He never\n      looked up from that occupation.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The Count continued his stroll away from the band. He returned slowly, he\n      said. I can imagine him enjoying to the full, but with his usual\n      tranquillity, the balminess of this southern night and the sounds of music\n      softened delightfully by the distance.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Presently, he approached for the third time the man on the garden seat,\n      still leaning forward with his elbows on his knees. It was a dejected\n      pose. In the semi-obscurity of the alley his high shirt collar and his\n      cuffs made small patches of vivid whiteness. The Count said that he had\n      noticed him getting up brusquely as if to walk away, but almost before he\n      was aware of it the man stood before him asking in a low, gentle tone\n      whether the signore would have the kindness to oblige him with a light.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The Count answered this request by a polite &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; and dropped his\n      hands with the intention of exploring both pockets of his trousers for the\n      matches.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I dropped my hands,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I never put them in my pockets. I felt\n      a pressure there&mdash;&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      He put the tip of his finger on a spot close under his breastbone, the\n      very spot of the human body where a Japanese gentleman begins the\n      operations of the Harakiri, which is a form of suicide following upon\n      dishonour, upon an intolerable outrage to the delicacy of one&rsquo;s feelings.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;I glance down,&rdquo; the Count continued in an awestruck voice, &ldquo;and what do I\n      see? A knife! A long knife&mdash;&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say,&rdquo; I exclaimed, amazed, &ldquo;that you have been held up\n      like this in the Villa at half-past ten o&rsquo;clock, within a stone&rsquo;s throw of\n      a thousand people!&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      He nodded several times, staring at me with all his might.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;The clarionet,&rdquo; he declared, solemnly, &ldquo;was finishing his solo, and I\n      assure you I could hear every note. Then the band crashed fortissimo, and\n      that creature rolled its eyes and gnashed its teeth hissing at me with the\n      greatest ferocity, &lsquo;Be silent! No noise or&mdash;&lsquo;&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      I could not get over my astonishment.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;What sort of knife was it?&rdquo; I asked, stupidly.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;A long blade. A stiletto&mdash;perhaps a kitchen knife. A long narrow\n      blade. It gleamed. And his eyes gleamed. His white teeth, too. I could see\n      them. He was very ferocious. I thought to myself: &lsquo;If I hit him he will\n      kill me.&rsquo; How could I fight with him? He had the knife and I had nothing.\n      I am nearly seventy, you know, and that was a young man. I seemed even to\n      recognize him. The moody young man of the cafe. The young man I met in the\n      crowd. But I could not tell. There are so many like him in this country.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The distress of that moment was reflected in his face. I should think that\n      physically he must have been paralyzed by surprise. His thoughts, however,\n      remained extremely active. They ranged over every alarming possibility.\n      The idea of setting up a vigorous shouting for help occurred to him, too.\n      But he did nothing of the kind, and the reason why he refrained gave me a\n      good opinion of his mental self-possession. He saw in a flash that nothing\n      prevented the other from shouting, too.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;That young man might in an instant have thrown away his knife and\n      pretended I was the aggressor. Why not? He might have said I attacked him.\n      Why not? It was one incredible story against another! He might have said\n      anything&mdash;bring some dishonouring charge against me&mdash;what do I\n      know? By his dress he was no common robber. He seemed to belong to the\n      better classes. What could I say? He was an Italian&mdash;I am a\n      foreigner. Of course, I have my passport, and there is our consul&mdash;but\n      to be arrested, dragged at night to the police office like a criminal!&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      He shuddered. It was in his character to shrink from scandal, much more\n      than from mere death. And certainly for many people this would have always\n      remained&mdash;considering certain peculiarities of Neapolitan manners&mdash;a\n      deucedly queer story. The Count was no fool. His belief in the respectable\n      placidity of life having received this rude shock, he thought that now\n      anything might happen. But also a notion came into his head that this\n      young man was perhaps merely an infuriated lunatic.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      This was for me the first hint of his attitude towards this adventure. In\n      his exaggerated delicacy of sentiment he felt that nobody&rsquo;s self-esteem\n      need be affected by what a madman may choose to do to one. It became\n      apparent, however, that the Count was to be denied that consolation. He\n      enlarged upon the abominably savage way in which that young man rolled his\n      glistening eyes and gnashed his white teeth. The band was going now\n      through a slow movement of solemn braying by all the trombones, with\n      deliberately repeated bangs of the big drum.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;But what did you do?&rdquo; I asked, greatly excited.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; answered the Count. &ldquo;I let my hands hang down very still. I\n      told him quietly I did not intend making a noise. He snarled like a dog,\n      then said in an ordinary voice:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Vostro portofolio.&rsquo;&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;So I naturally,&rdquo; continued the Count&mdash;and from this point acted the\n      whole thing in pantomime. Holding me with his eyes, he went through all\n      the motions of reaching into his inside breast pocket, taking out a\n      pocket-book, and handing it over. But that young man, still bearing\n      steadily on the knife, refused to touch it.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He directed the Count to take the money out himself, received it into his\n      left hand, motioned the pocketbook to be returned to the pocket, all this\n      being done to the sweet thrilling of flutes and clarionets sustained by\n      the emotional drone of the hautboys. And the &ldquo;young man,&rdquo; as the Count\n      called him, said: &ldquo;This seems very little.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;It was, indeed, only 340 or 360 lire,&rdquo; the Count pursued. &ldquo;I had left my\n      money in the hotel, as you know. I told him this was all I had on me. He\n      shook his head impatiently and said:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Vostro orologio.&rsquo;&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The Count gave me the dumb show of pulling out his watch, detaching it.\n      But, as it happened, the valuable gold half-chronometer he possessed had\n      been left at a watch-maker&rsquo;s for cleaning. He wore that evening (on a\n      leather guard) the Waterbury fifty-franc thing he used to take with him on\n      his fishing expeditions. Perceiving the nature of this booty, the\n      well-dressed robber made a contemptuous clicking sound with his tongue\n      like this, &ldquo;Tse-Ah!&rdquo; and waved it away hastily. Then, as the Count was\n      returning the disdained object to his pocket, he demanded with a\n      threateningly increased pressure of the knife on the epigastrium, by way\n      of reminder:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;&lsquo;Vostri anelli.&rsquo;&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;One of the rings,&rdquo; went on the Count, &ldquo;was given me many years ago by my\n      wife; the other is the signet ring of my father. I said, &lsquo;No. That you\n      shall not have!&rsquo;&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Here the Count reproduced the gesture corresponding to that declaration by\n      clapping one hand upon the other, and pressing both thus against his\n      chest. It was touching in its resignation. &ldquo;That you shall not have,&rdquo; he\n      repeated, firmly, and closed his eyes, fully expecting&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know\n      whether I am right in recording that such an unpleasant word had passed\n      his lips&mdash;fully expecting to feel himself being&mdash;I really\n      hesitate to say&mdash;being disembowelled by the push of the long, sharp\n      blade resting murderously against the pit of his stomach&mdash;the very\n      seat, in all human beings, of anguishing sensations.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Great waves of harmony went on flowing from the band.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Suddenly the Count felt the nightmarish pressure removed from the\n      sensitive spot. He opened his eyes. He was alone. He had heard nothing. It\n      is probable that &ldquo;the young man&rdquo; had departed, with light steps, some time\n      before, but the sense of the horrid pressure had lingered even after the\n      knife had gone. A feeling of weakness came over him. He had just time to\n      stagger to the garden seat. He felt as though he had held his breath for a\n      long time. He sat all in a heap, panting with the shock of the reaction.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The band was executing, with immense bravura, the complicated finale. It\n      ended with a tremendous crash. He heard it unreal and remote, as if his\n      ears had been stopped, and then the hard clapping of a thousand, more or\n      less, pairs of hands, like a sudden hail-shower passing away. The profound\n      silence which succeeded recalled him to himself.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      A tramcar resembling a long glass box wherein people sat with their heads\n      strongly lighted, ran along swiftly within sixty yards of the spot where\n      he had been robbed. Then another rustled by, and yet another going the\n      other way. The audience about the band had broken up, and were entering\n      the alley in small conversing groups. The Count sat up straight and tried\n      to think calmly of what had happened to him. The vileness of it took his\n      breath away again. As far as I can make it out he was disgusted with\n      himself. I do not mean to say with his behaviour. Indeed, if his\n      pantomimic rendering of it for my information was to be trusted, it was\n      simply perfect. No, it was not that. He was not ashamed. He was shocked at\n      being the selected victim, not of robbery so much as of contempt. His\n      tranquillity had been wantonly desecrated. His lifelong, kindly nicety of\n      outlook had been defaced.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Nevertheless, at that stage, before the iron had time to sink deep, he was\n      able to argue himself into comparative equanimity. As his agitation calmed\n      down somewhat, he became aware that he was frightfully hungry. Yes,\n      hungry. The sheer emotion had made him simply ravenous. He left the seat\n      and, after walking for some time, found himself outside the gardens and\n      before an arrested tramcar, without knowing very well how he came there.\n      He got in as if in a dream, by a sort of instinct. Fortunately he found in\n      his trouser pocket a copper to satisfy the conductor. Then the car\n      stopped, and as everybody was getting out he got out, too. He recognized\n      the Piazza San Ferdinando, but apparently it did not occur to him to take\n      a cab and drive to the hotel. He remained in distress on the Piazza like a\n      lost dog, thinking vaguely of the best way of getting something to eat at\n      once.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Suddenly he remembered his twenty-franc piece. He explained to me that he\n      had that piece of French gold for something like three years. He used to\n      carry it about with him as a sort of reserve in case of accident. Anybody\n      is liable to have his pocket picked&mdash;a quite different thing from a\n      brazen and insulting robbery.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The monumental arch of the Galleria Umberto faced him at the top of a\n      noble flight of stairs. He climbed these without loss of time, and\n      directed his steps towards the Cafe Umberto. All the tables outside were\n      occupied by a lot of people who were drinking. But as he wanted something\n      to eat, he went inside into the cafe, which is divided into aisles by\n      square pillars set all round with long looking-glasses. The Count sat down\n      on a red plush bench against one of these pillars, waiting for his\n      risotto. And his mind reverted to his abominable adventure.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      He thought of the moody, well-dressed young man, with whom he had\n      exchanged glances in the crowd around the bandstand, and who, he felt\n      confident, was the robber. Would he recognize him again? Doubtless. But he\n      did not want ever to see him again. The best thing was to forget this\n      humiliating episode.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The Count looked round anxiously for the coming of his risotto, and,\n      behold! to the left against the wall&mdash;there sat the young man. He was\n      alone at a table, with a bottle of some sort of wine or syrup and a carafe\n      of iced water before him. The smooth olive cheeks, the red lips, the\n      little jet-black moustache turned up gallantly, the fine black eyes a\n      little heavy and shaded by long eyelashes, that peculiar expression of\n      cruel discontent to be seen only in the busts of some Roman emperors&mdash;it\n      was he, no doubt at all. But that was a type. The Count looked away\n      hastily. The young officer over there reading a paper was like that, too.\n      Same type. Two young men farther away playing draughts also resembled&mdash;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The Count lowered his head with the fear in his heart of being\n      everlastingly haunted by the vision of that young man. He began to eat his\n      risotto. Presently he heard the young man on his left call the waiter in a\n      bad-tempered tone.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      At the call, not only his own waiter, but two other idle waiters belonging\n      to a quite different row of tables, rushed towards him with obsequious\n      alacrity, which is not the general characteristic of the waiters in the\n      Cafe Umberto. The young man muttered something and one of the waiters\n      walking rapidly to the nearest door called out into the Galleria:\n      &ldquo;Pasquale! O! Pasquale!&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Everybody knows Pasquale, the shabby old fellow who, shuffling between the\n      tables, offers for sale cigars, cigarettes, picture postcards, and matches\n      to the clients of the cafe. He is in many respects an engaging scoundrel.\n      The Count saw the grey-haired, unshaven ruffian enter the cafe, the glass\n      case hanging from his neck by a leather strap, and, at a word from the\n      waiter, make his shuffling way with a sudden spurt to the young man&rsquo;s\n      table. The young man was in need of a cigar with which Pasquale served him\n      fawningly. The old pedlar was going out, when the Count, on a sudden\n      impulse, beckoned to him.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Pasquale approached, the smile of deferential recognition combining oddly\n      with the cynical searching expression of his eyes. Leaning his case on the\n      table, he lifted the glass lid without a word. The Count took a box of\n      cigarettes and urged by a fearful curiosity, asked as casually as he could&mdash;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Tell me, Pasquale, who is that young signore sitting over there?&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The other bent over his box confidentially.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;That, Signor Conde,&rdquo; he said, beginning to rearrange his wares busily and\n      without looking up, &ldquo;that is a young Cavaliere of a very good family from\n      Bari. He studies in the University here, and is the chief, capo, of an\n      association of young men&mdash;of very nice young men.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      He paused, and then, with mingled discretion and pride of knowledge,\n      murmured the explanatory word &ldquo;Camorra&rdquo; and shut down the lid. &ldquo;A very\n      powerful Camorra,&rdquo; he breathed out. &ldquo;The professors themselves respect it\n      greatly . . . una lira e cinquanti centesimi, Signor Conde.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      Our friend paid with the gold piece. While Pasquale was making up the\n      change, he observed that the young man, of whom he had heard so much in a\n      few words, was watching the transaction covertly. After the old vagabond\n      had withdrawn with a bow, the Count settled with the waiter and sat still.\n      A numbness, he told me, had come over him.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The young man paid, too, got up, and crossed over, apparently for the\n      purpose of looking at himself in the mirror set in the pillar nearest to\n      the Count&rsquo;s seat. He was dressed all in black with a dark green bow tie.\n      The Count looked round, and was startled by meeting a vicious glance out\n      of the corners of the other&rsquo;s eyes. The young Cavaliere from Bari\n      (according to Pasquale; but Pasquale is, of course, an accomplished liar)\n      went on arranging his tie, settling his hat before the glass, and meantime\n      he spoke just loud enough to be heard by the Count. He spoke through his\n      teeth with the most insulting venom of contempt and gazing straight into\n      the mirror.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      &ldquo;Ah! So you had some gold on you&mdash;you old liar&mdash;you old birba&mdash;you\n      furfante! But you are not done with me yet.&rdquo;\n     </p>\n    <p>\n      The fiendishness of his expression vanished like lightning, and he lounged\n      out of the cafe with a moody, impassive face.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The poor Count, after telling me this last episode, fell back trembling in\n      his chair. His forehead broke into perspiration. There was a wanton\n      insolence in the spirit of this outrage which appalled even me. What it\n      was to the Count&rsquo;s delicacy I won&rsquo;t attempt to guess. I am sure that if he\n      had been not too refined to do such a blatantly vulgar thing as dying from\n      apoplexy in a cafe, he would have had a fatal stroke there and then. All\n      irony apart, my difficulty was to keep him from seeing the full extent of\n      my commiseration. He shrank from every excessive sentiment, and my\n      commiseration was practically unbounded. It did not surprise me to hear\n      that he had been in bed a week. He had got up to make his arrangements for\n      leaving Southern Italy for good and all.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      And the man was convinced that he could not live through a whole year in\n      any other climate!\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      No argument of mine had any effect. It was not timidity, though he did say\n      to me once: &ldquo;You do not know what a Camorra is, my dear sir. I am a marked\n      man.&rdquo; He was not afraid of what could be done to him. His delicate\n      conception of his dignity was defiled by a degrading experience. He\n      couldn&rsquo;t stand that. No Japanese gentleman, outraged in his exaggerated\n      sense of honour, could have gone about his preparations for Hara-kiri with\n      greater resolution. To go home really amounted to suicide for the poor\n      Count.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      There is a saying of Neapolitan patriotism, intended for the information\n      of foreigners, I presume: &ldquo;See Naples and then die.&rdquo; Vedi Napoli e poi\n      mori. It is a saying of excessive vanity, and everything excessive was\n      abhorrent to the nice moderation of the poor Count. Yet, as I was seeing\n      him off at the railway station, I thought he was behaving with singular\n      fidelity to its conceited spirit. Vedi Napoli! . . . He had seen it! He\n      had seen it with startling thoroughness&mdash;and now he was going to his\n      grave. He was going to it by the train de luxe of the International\n      Sleeping Car Company, via Trieste and Vienna. As the four long, sombre\n      coaches pulled out of the station I raised my hat with the solemn feeling\n      of paying the last tribute of respect to a funeral cortege. Il Conde&rsquo;s\n      profile, much aged already, glided away from me in stony immobility,\n      behind the lighted pane of glass&mdash;Vedi Napoli e poi mori!\n    </p>\n<pre xml:space=\"preserve\">"}

J.\n\nTRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.\n\nThe book I have had the privilege of translating is, undoubtedly,\none of the most remarkable studies of the social and psychological\ncondition of the modern world which has appeared in Europe for many\nyears, and its influence is sure to be lasting and far reaching.\nTolstoy's genius is beyond dispute. The verdict of the civilized\nworld has pronounced him as perhaps the greatest novelist of our\ngeneration. But the philosophical and religious works of his later\nyears have met with a somewhat indifferent reception. They have\nbeen much talked about, simply because they were his work, but, as\nTolstoy himself complains, they have never been seriously discussed.\nI hardly think that he will have to repeat the complaint in regard\nto the present volume. One may disagree with his views, but no one\ncan seriously deny the originality, boldness, and depth of the social\nconception which he develops with such powerful logic. The novelist\nhas shown in this book the religious fervor and spiritual insight\nof the prophet; yet one is pleased to recognize that the artist is\nnot wholly lost in the thinker. The subtle intuitive perception of\nthe psychological basis of the social position, the analysis of the\nframe of mind of oppressors and oppressed, and of the intoxication of\nAuthority and Servility, as well as the purely descriptive passages\nin the last chapter--these could only have come from the author of\n\"War and Peace.\"\n\nThe book will surely give all classes of readers much to think of,\nand must call forth much criticism. It must be refuted by those who\ndisapprove of its teaching, if they do not want it to have great\ninfluence.\n\nOne cannot of course anticipate that English people, slow as they are\nto be influenced by ideas, and instinctively distrustful of all that\nis logical, will take a leap in the dark and attempt to put Tolstoy's\ntheory of life into practice. But one may at least be sure that his\ndestructive criticism of the present social and political _r\u00e9gime_\nwill become a powerful force in the work of disintegration and social\nreconstruction which is going on around us. Many earnest thinkers\nwho, like Tolstoy, are struggling to find their way out of the\ncontradictions of our social order will hail him as their spiritual\nguide. The individuality of the author is felt in every line of his\nwork, and even the most prejudiced cannot resist the fascination\nof his genuineness, sincerity, and profound earnestness. Whatever\ncomes from a heart such as his, swelling with anger and pity at the\nsufferings of humanity, cannot fail to reach the hearts of others. No\nreader can put down the book without feeling himself better and more\ntruth-loving for having read it."}

It is in such a wise that\nmemory plays its pranks for good or ill; for pleasure or pain; for weal\nor woe.  It is thus that life is bittersweet, and that which has been\ndone becomes eternal.\n\nAgain, the light skiff, ceasing to shoot through the lazy water as when\nthe oars flashed and dripped, glided out of the fierce July sunlight\ninto the cool shade of the great drooping willow branches\u2014I standing\nup in the swaying boat, she sitting still and with deft fingers\nguarding herself from stray twigs or the freedom of the resilience of\nmoving boughs.  Again, the water looked golden-brown under the canopy\nof translucent green; and the grassy bank was of emerald hue.  Again,\nwe sat in the cool shade, with the myriad noises of nature both without\nand within our bower merging into that drowsy hum in whose sufficing\nenvironment the great world with its disturbing trouble, and its more\ndisturbing joys, can be effectually forgotten.  Again, in that blissful\nsolitude the young girl lost the convention of her prim, narrow\nupbringing, and told me in a natural, dreamy way of the loneliness of\nher new life. With an undertone of sadness she made me feel how in that\nspacious home each one of the household was isolated by the personal\nmagnificence of her father and herself; that there confidence had no\naltar, and sympathy no shrine; and that there even her father\u2019s face\nwas as distant as the old country life seemed now.  Once more, the\nwisdom of my manhood and the experience of my years laid themselves at\nthe girl\u2019s feet.  It was seemingly their own doing; for the individual\n\u201cI\u201d had no say in the matter, but only just obeyed imperative orders.\nAnd once again the flying seconds multiplied themselves endlessly.  For\nit is in the arcana of dreams that existences merge and renew\nthemselves, change and yet keep the same\u2014like the soul of a musician\nin a fugue.  And so memory swooned, again and again, in sleep.\n\nIt seems that there is never to be any perfect rest.  Even in Eden the\nsnake rears its head among the laden boughs of the Tree of Knowledge.\nThe silence of the dreamless night is broken by the roar of the\navalanche; the hissing of sudden floods; the clanging of the engine\nbell marking its sweep through a sleeping American town; the clanking\nof distant paddles over the sea....  Whatever it is, it is breaking the\ncharm of my Eden.  The canopy of greenery above us, starred with\ndiamond-points of light, seems to quiver in the ceaseless beat of\npaddles; and the restless bell seems as though it would never cease...."}

He was gilded all over with thin leaves of fine gold, for eyes\nhe had two bright sapphires, and a large red ruby glowed on his\nsword-hilt.\n\nHe was very much admired indeed.  \u201cHe is as beautiful as a weathercock,\u201d\nremarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for\nhaving artistic tastes; \u201conly not quite so useful,\u201d he added, fearing\nlest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not.\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t you be like the Happy Prince?\u201d asked a sensible mother of her\nlittle boy who was crying for the moon.  \u201cThe Happy Prince never dreams\nof crying for anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am glad there is some one in the world who is quite happy,\u201d muttered a\ndisappointed man as he gazed at the wonderful statue.\n\n\u201cHe looks just like an angel,\u201d said the Charity Children as they came out\nof the cathedral in their bright scarlet cloaks and their clean white\npinafores.\n\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d said the Mathematical Master, \u201cyou have never seen\none.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh! but we have, in our dreams,\u201d answered the children; and the\nMathematical Master frowned and looked very severe, for he did not\napprove of children dreaming.\n\nOne night there flew over the city a little Swallow.  His friends had\ngone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he was\nin love with the most beautiful Reed.  He had met her early in the spring\nas he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so\nattracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her.\n\n\u201cShall I love you?\u201d said the Swallow, who liked to come to the point at\nonce, and the Reed made him a low bow.  So he flew round and round her,\ntouching the water with his wings, and making silver ripples.  This was\nhis courtship, and it lasted all through the summer.\n\n\u201cIt is a ridiculous attachment,\u201d twittered the other Swallows; \u201cshe has\nno money, and far too many relations\u201d; and indeed the river was quite\nfull of Reeds.  Then, when the autumn came they all flew away."}

UNDER THE GREENWOOD TREE\n\nPREFACE\n\nThis story of the Mellstock Quire and its old established west-gallery\nmusicians, with some supplementary descriptions of similar officials in\n_Two on a Tower, A Few Crusted Characters_, and other places, is\nintended to be a fairly true picture, at first hand, of the personages,\nways, and customs which were common among such orchestral bodies in the\nvillages of fifty or sixty years ago.\n\nOne is inclined to regret the displacement of these ecclesiastical\nbandsmen by an isolated organist (often at first a barrel-organist) or\nharmonium player; and despite certain advantages in point of control\nand accomplishment which were, no doubt, secured by installing the\nsingle artist, the change has tended to stultify the professed aims of\nthe clergy, its direct result being to curtail and extinguish the\ninterest of parishioners in church doings. Under the old plan, from\nhalf a dozen to ten full-grown players, in addition to the numerous\nmore or less grown-up singers, were officially occupied with the Sunday\nroutine, and concerned in trying their best to make it an artistic\noutcome of the combined musical taste of the congregation. With a\nmusical executive limited, as it mostly is limited now, to the parson\u2019s\nwife or daughter and the school-children, or to the school-teacher and\nthe children, an important union of interests has disappeared.\n\nThe zest of these bygone instrumentalists must have been keen and\nstaying to take them, as it did, on foot every Sunday after a toilsome\nweek, through all weathers, to the church, which often lay at a\ndistance from their homes. They usually received so little in payment\nfor their performances that their efforts were really a labour of love.\nIn the parish I had in my mind when writing the present tale, the\ngratuities received yearly by the musicians at Christmas were somewhat\nas follows: From the manor-house ten shillings and a supper; from the\nvicar ten shillings; from the farmers five shillings each; from each\ncottage-household one shilling; amounting altogether to not more than\nten shillings a head annually\u2014just enough, as an old executant told me,\nto pay for their fiddle-strings, repairs, rosin, and music-paper (which\nthey mostly ruled themselves). Their music in those days was all in\ntheir own manuscript, copied in the evenings after work, and their\nmusic-books were home-bound."}

There are very few now.\n\nOf the monstrous neglect of education in England, and the disregard\nof it by the State as a means of forming good or bad citizens, and\nmiserable or happy men, private schools long afforded a notable example.\nAlthough any man who had proved his unfitness for any other occupation\nin life, was free, without examination or qualification, to open a\nschool anywhere; although preparation for the functions he undertook,\nwas required in the surgeon who assisted to bring a boy into the world,\nor might one day assist, perhaps, to send him out of it; in the chemist,\nthe attorney, the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker; the whole\nround of crafts and trades, the schoolmaster excepted; and although\nschoolmasters, as a race, were the blockheads and impostors who might\nnaturally be expected to spring from such a state of things, and to\nflourish in it; these Yorkshire schoolmasters were the lowest and most\nrotten round in the whole ladder. Traders in the avarice, indifference,\nor imbecility of parents, and the helplessness of children; ignorant,\nsordid, brutal men, to whom few considerate persons would have entrusted\nthe board and lodging of a horse or a dog; they formed the worthy\ncornerstone of a structure, which, for absurdity and a magnificent\nhigh-minded LAISSEZ-ALLER neglect, has rarely been exceeded in the\nworld.\n\nWe hear sometimes of an action for damages against the unqualified\nmedical practitioner, who has deformed a broken limb in pretending to\nheal it. But, what of the hundreds of thousands of minds that have been\ndeformed for ever by the incapable pettifoggers who have pretended to\nform them!\n\nI make mention of the race, as of the Yorkshire schoolmasters, in the\npast tense. Though it has not yet finally disappeared, it is dwindling\ndaily. A long day\u2019s work remains to be done about us in the way of\neducation, Heaven knows; but great improvements and facilities towards\nthe attainment of a good one, have been furnished, of late years.\n\nI cannot call to mind, now, how I came to hear about Yorkshire schools\nwhen I was a not very robust child, sitting in bye-places near Rochester\nCastle, with a head full of PARTRIDGE, STRAP, TOM PIPES, and SANCHO\nPANZA; but I know that my first impressions of them were picked up\nat that time, and that they were somehow or other connected with a\nsuppurated abscess that some boy had come home with, in consequence of\nhis Yorkshire guide, philosopher, and friend, having ripped it open with\nan inky pen-knife. The impression made upon me, however made, never left\nme. I was always curious about Yorkshire schools--fell, long afterwards\nand at sundry times, into the way of hearing more about them--at last,\nhaving an audience, resolved to write about them."}
